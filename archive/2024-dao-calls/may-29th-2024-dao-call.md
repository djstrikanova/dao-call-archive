Effect AI Decentralization Discussion

* DJSTRIKANOVA discusses recent Fit21 US legislation that seeks to set up a sort of "decentralization test" that evaluates whether cryptocurrencies are sufficiently decentralized.
* Jesse discusses how the DAO can be incorporated into upgrading EOS smart contracts related to EOS. Such as through HG approval.
* Rochelle discusses decentralization in the context of Effect Force, how workers shouldn't be completely at the mercy of requestors. Jesse discusses how Effect Force front-end can be moderated, but the underlying protocol can not be. So filters can restrict malicious requestors, but if there is a true dispute people can fork Effect Force front-end and implement their own moderation.
* Jesse discusses the final step remaining such that any DAO member can push the cycle forward and that there is an updated needed that is still on the docket.
* Discussion over how the Solana Bridge, Liqidity Pools and initial Solana EFX mint fit into the context of decentralization.
