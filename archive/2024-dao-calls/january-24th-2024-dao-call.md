January 24th, Effect DAO Call Short Summary

* Jesse is back from Holiday.
* A new developer will start on the team next week and the week after potentially another developer. Both will start out working part time and will be encouraged to participate in discord. (Normie took a better paying job offer.)
* David has been on holiday for a while, but expected to get back to work in the next month.
* Jesse discusses V2 improvements anticipated with a big focus on scalability and performance.
  * There is a distinction between V2 as it's coming out soon which is a set of improvements and then the long-term plan for Effect Network.
* Jesse discusses looking ahead to adapt to AI technology space, how to make V2 appeal primarily to big datasets.
* Jesse discusses the difficulty in getting traction in EOS ecosystem including attracting exchanges to list EFX.
* Jesse is satisfied with EOS on a technology level. However, Defi is very limited. Defibox is still not listed on Coinmarketcap. The Pancakeswap pool hasn't really been working as well either. Jesse was interested in DAO's opinion about expanding to other ecosystems such as Solana.
* A general discussion between Jesse and DJSTRIKANOVA about what an expansion to Solana could entail (not migration, but potential of a bridge).
* Jesse also brainstorms improvements to tokenomics (such as revisiting Galaxy Pool concepts).
* Proposal #148 passed unanimously (Alan intended to vote no), so the Pancakeswap Farm rewards pool will be paused until the DAO decides otherwise.
  * No action necessary as the farm has already expired
* Jesse will work on writing a guide to draft an ATP so other DAO members can do it.
* Be helpful to people racing to move their funds in light of the Kucoin deadline to withdraw coming up (Jan 28th, 10:00 UTC).
