* v2 progress is coming along development side. Jeff is making a lot of progress, Jesse is very happy with how the SDK v2 refactor is coming along. You can monitor his contributions at https://github.com/Jeffrieh or in the "github-updates" channel on Discord.
* Pre-Registration for v2 workers will be coming soon, within the next week Rochelle has said. Workers will get an access code, this is to ensure that the first set of workers on the platform are capable and reliable (not bots or spammers). Rochelle plans on limiting how many workers are onboarded so those who are able to join have a good amount of work to do. Jesse says he wants to sustain 1000 workers with tasks in the next months of rolling out. In the past, having it too open meant tasks were completed so quickly many workers didn't have work to do. This will be considered early access for v2. With more access granted as more tasks are rolled out.
* Laurens, Jesse and Jeff have hashed out the architectural aspects of the Solana Bridge, of which the proposal for has passed nearly unanimously with one abstain.
* Jesse mentions he does not have exact specifics on how big the Solana Native EFX LP pool will be, but did say "fairly well sized pool"
* Jesse suggested that if anyone has an opinion on a good size for the Solana Native EFX LP pool, to post in Discord their opinion.
* Discussion over finding a CEX for EFX. Jesse mentioned that generally, exchanges want high volume and low complexity. With a Solana Native EFX token, both those characteristics could be satisfied, as EOS these days is considered an "exotic chain".
* DJSTRIKANOVA discusses his USDT General Reserve Fund proposal. Selling 20k EFX every week, if EFX is greater than 4 cents to build up a USDT fund. This fund could be used for DAO initiatives, beefing up Liquidity pools or increasing Hackathon prize pools further. The Supplement would sell 100k EFX at 10 cents to further strengthen this fund.
* DJSTRIKANOVA discusses an initiative to build up a BSC LP with pNetwork. pNetwork provides the bridging service between BSC EFX and EOS EFX. They are in need of getting more liquidity on DEX's and both DAO's pitching in for an EFX/PNT LP would improve liquidity for both tokens.
