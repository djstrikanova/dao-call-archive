DAO Call Summary March 6th, 2024

* Jesse discusses that v2 is coming along, potentially a demo coming out by next DAO call, possibly. Pre-registration system is being worked on for worker onboarding.
* Discussion about Effect AI rebrand proposal. DAO voted for it unanimously, both Jesse and Laurens endorse it as well.
* Jesse discusses how the Effect website will be having lots of changes in line with the name rebranding among other needed updates.
* DJSTRIKANOVA (DJ) discusses his proposal to start another 90 day farm on Defibox for 50,000 EFX and the potential of farms on Solana after V2 and the bridge are done. Jesse and Laurens both confirm they're for having an EFX bridge to Solana to expand platform access. The potential for a Raydium farm is discussed.
* Jesse and Laurens discuss the difference between bridging to Solana and migration. The first step is creating a bridge, to expand access. However, Jesse and Laurens both mention that there are potential ways of having utility on Solana natively. All of this is still being hammered out, so there are no specifics, but they confirm there is a goal of bringing EFX utility to Solana beyond just a bridge.
* DJ discusses his proposal to start building up a USDT prize pool for a potential future hackathon.
* Jesse provides a summary of the pythonSDK and how it factors in v2. How it's important that people involved in AI have libraries for languages that they are already familiar with when they want to build on Effect AI.
* Jesse discusses his proposal to expand the EOS/NFX liquidity pool, make it more visible on Defibox, as the EFX/NFX pool itself was even more obscure. This will make it easier for people to buy NFX and participate.
* Rochelle Discusses her upcoming Marketing Committee and invites any interested DAO members to join. It is March 13th, 6PM CET.
