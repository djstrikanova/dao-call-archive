* V2 Worker App is live and deployed with some tasks and campaigns ready to be completed. https://app.effect.ai/access
* To complete tasks one must have an access-code, which will be an NFT. These codes will be sent out in the next few days for a select group of workers.
* First group will be small for feedback sessions over things like user experience and interface design. As time goes on, more waitlist workers will be given access codes.
* Those who filled out the waitlist will get a message from Rochelle on discord (Make sure to verify it is exactly rochelle\_ai, if unsure you can always doublecheck by asking in discord general chat)
* It's not too late to sign up for the waitlist, see Effect AI X for links. https://x.com/effectaix/status/1795061662526910572
* Requestors can use the Python SDK to create tasks and campaigns. Jesse is also working on CLI tools to help streamline the process of generating templates and publishing datasets. Such as using an LLM to help generate Requestor html templates.
* Discussion about external clients which are Web3 projects, the time-lines depend on them, so the process is slow.
* Jesse discusses the timing of the Solana Bridge along with the onboarding of client projects.
* DJSTRIKANOVA discusses ATP proposals, the 500k EFX supplement to the EFX/PNT pool and the Newdex Test ATP that creates a test sell order of a small amount of EFX to see if it works.
* DJSTRIKANOVA discusses the news that USDT support for EOS is ending in 12 months, so Effect DAO will need to find something to replace it's current USDT reserves.
* DAO Discussion over how to best adapt to these changes.
