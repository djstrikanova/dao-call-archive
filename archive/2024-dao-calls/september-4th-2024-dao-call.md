Effect AI is shifting towards a full migration towards the Solana chain because the EOS tokenomics have changed such that it is too expensive to do the transactions needed for Effect Force. Furthermore, too much manpower is needed to optimize Effect Force on EOS. As EOS is a very obscure chain, the team has reached a consensus that the most effective use of the team's resources and time is to prioritize a full migration towards Solana.

* Effect Force EOS v2 is stable and functional, but the price of RAM requires optimizations for worker resource management. Jeffrey is the head engineer responsible for these optimizations and after discussing with Jesse there is a consensus that the time would be better spent prioritizing a migration to Solana. At first the team was daunted by the idea of moving Effect Force to Solana, but after dealing with these EOS issues the team has decided it's the best path forward. A big factor is the new EOS tokenomics that explicitly focuses on increasing the price of RAM.
* Jesse discusses the manpower necessary to implement the full migration. The full migration does not require starting from scratch, as much already created can be reused for Solana. Jesse estimates 60%-70% of what EOS V2 currently is reusable on Solana. Jesse states that the team will be increased in size. Jesse is confident that having a bold goal and the technical details ready will make it easier to fund and find the extra devs necessary.
* Jesse discusses a consolidated solution for EFX that gets rid of fragmentation. That means all aspects on Solana, hence "full migration." Proposals will be drafted for voting on by the DAO, and a new white paper focused on Solana implementation will be finalized. Clear technical goals and steps needed will be drafted and voted on. Encrypted data is necessary for implementation and will be done on Solana. There will also be a token migration that will be voted on by the DAO once it is all written. The DAO will need to approve the migration.
* Jesse states he will attend Solana Breakpoint.
* There is an opportunity to change EFX tokenomics if it is desired. For example, everything can be consolidated into the EFX token. Such a thing will require a vote by the DAO.
