* Jesse flooded in Dubai
* v2 Early Access Worker Registration is live, see here: https://twitter.com/effectaix/status/1778824109079585031
* Developer David Britt is back from his sabbatical and working on v2 with Jeff, many commits on Github.
* Rochelle reaching out to Amazon Turk micro-taskers to join early access, as workers will have EOS accounts created for them. So less crypto knowledge will be necessary to be a worker.
* Reserve Fund proposals have passed, as have the pNetwork EFX/PNT collaboration. DJSTRIKANOVA will be working with pNetwork DAO to move that initiative forward.
* DJSTRIKANOVA making progress on updating token sites. BSCscan has been updated, https://bscscan.com/token/0xc51ef828319b131b595b7ec4b28210ecf4d05ad0
* Coingecko Updates have been submitted, waiting on their response
