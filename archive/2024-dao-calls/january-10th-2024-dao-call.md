### January 10th, 2024 DAO Call Summary

* Jesse has been talking with Noman (Normie on Discord), who has graduated recently, to bring on to the Effect team fully. Looks like more details will be out in the coming weeks.
* Rochelle and Jesse making progress with Open Empathic template, have some bugs that need addressing.
* Discuss various global AI issues that trend towards more opportunity for Effect Force data curation. LAION's abusive imagery scandal, Copyright infringement lawsuits across all domains of AI models (Github CoPilot).
* Laurens discusses V2. V2 is intended to be much more scalable than V1 (current version). For example, currently a batch can only have 300 tasks, repetitions are included in this limit. Still some steps remain. Because the goal is having everything work with V2. Python SDK important for appealing to AI and Data scientist developers.
* DJSTRIKANOVA asks Laurens about any "Grand Design" visions involving Nosana and Effect, considering that Nosana is focused on GPU compute for AI and Effect Network is focused on building datasets for models. Laurens replies that the current primary focus of V2 is replacing V1 with something much more scalable. However, after V2 there is definitely opportunity for collaboration.
* Alan asks several questions over lack of activity in Discord.
  * Laurens discusses Nosana and Effect and how while the current focus is on V2, there is room for potential collaboration in the future. One potential example is Whisper which is a Speech to Text model. Whisper is pretty good, but not perfect in it's transcriptions. Effect Force's workforce can potentially be used to improve such transcriptions. However, such experimentation is still preferred to happen once V2 is ready, as V2 will be scalable.
* The general goal for V2 is the 1st quarter of 2024, but there is no definitive date given by Laurens or Jesse for now.
* Discussion over continuing the pancake swap farm for the next quarter. Rochelle said she will ask Jesse to publish the proposal.
* Rochelle is preparing on the workforce side for V2, suggests that something to look out for is a wait list signup for workers to test V2.
