* Jesse is back from Solana Breakpoint in Singapore, met many people and discussed Effect AI with people that were interested.
* Jesse describes two technical documents being worked on. The Effect AI whitepaper that modernizes the previous whitepaper and the blueprint for the migration.
* Jesse is working on expanding the team in regards to marketing and development.
* Laurens discusses the need to update the whitepaper to adapt to modern AI practices.
* Laurens and Jesse say that the token migration will be more than just a bridge with a time limit and this will be explained in a blueprint.
* DJSTRIKANOVA discusses various suggestions, such as allowing Stablecoins to be used as payment by requestors but with a higher network fee, such as 25%. Other methods could be allowing other tokens that require a liquidity pool such that is converted into EFX in the backend.
* Laurens and DJSTRIKANOVA discuss how Effect AI needs better incentives to attract requestors, such as managers who can manage workers and extract small fees from them.
* DJSTRIKANOVA discusses with Laurens and Jesse whether there is advantage in moving to a single token model (EFX) instead of the current two token one (EFX and NFX). There are mixed opinions.
* Jesse suggests another call, potentially on a different platform from Discord and time slot where the team can prepare ahead of time and plan to attend. This call would involve more in depth and concrete discussions about the whitepaper and blueprint.
