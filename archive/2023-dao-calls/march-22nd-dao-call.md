#### DJSTRIKANOVA

It okay. It's recording.

#### David B

Okay, great. Hi everybody. Welcome to the Dow meeting for Effect Network on the 22 December, March 2023. Do we have any items on the agenda today? SPEAKER C

It does not collect anybody at any minute right now.

#### David B

Okay, cool.

#### Jesse Eisses

So we can just have more of an open, quick sync discussion, I guess. I guess we have proposals right now that are in review, I guess processing.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, let's talk about them. So the ATP, is it just going to be the transaction we have to sign and it sends it the Efx?

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah, exactly. So the ATP, I'll prepare the transaction there. Yeah, it will send the Efx 230. So that's enough in the budget for it. Yeah, that will just be executed and go to Candy. What's it called? Candy.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

And then rochelle, you're working on the Chinese translations, right? SPEAKER C

Yes, and so far I cannot get anybody in house. Our old Kraft Heinz translators, one I was able to contact, but she does not have the availability.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

There's Eosbs, if you want to talk to them. They're the ones who translated my grant?

#### David B

Yeah, they do five cents per word, and they're pretty quick about it as well. SPEAKER C

What do you guys think?

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah, no problem to translate. I think you can just take care of it now. We shall either go to USB or anywhere. It's about the pitch that we made, right? The document? Yeah. Up to you. Just get it translated. Of course Effect will pay for it, but yeah, it's up to you.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

As long as you give them the Raw document so they can edit the text. I think that that one. I don't think it'll be too expensive. SPEAKER C

Okay, I will handle that. If they're that quick, we should probably see it, I think, by Monday. You'd think, right?

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I think so. It took two days for them to translate my grant, and that's a lot more text, I think, though. I guess the only issue is if they can translate it's like a PowerPoint, right? Or the equivalent on Google. SPEAKER C

Yeah, it's Google Slides, which we can give them access. Make a copy and give them access to that one. I'll get it set up. I'm looking.

#### Jesse Eisses

So what happens next when the funds are in their wallet? Is there any action required? Does some of us need to get in touch with their team on setting up the next steps, or will they just take care of it? You probably know best, DJ, because the.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

First two steps they wanted was to transfer the Efx and then have promotional materials ready. And the Chinese stuff, I decided to just say to recommend that as well because they have a big Chinese speaking audience. So maybe my answer is maybe. There may need to be more I can ask. I know they wanted to kind of have they suggested a dual AMA where community members from both communities can ask questions about the other project? If any effect. Community members had questions about other D Five box stuff like their vault and their loans and stuff like that, and then in reverse. So that's why I think it's good to have those Chinese translations because then it could kind of prompt interest from their community and maybe they could ask questions. So yeah, maybe like an AMA later on. I don't know.

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah, sounds good. Maybe are you talking to them on Telegram? Because maybe we can create a group and me and Rochelle can be in there as well just to take on some of the organization around doing an AMA, getting the Chinese translations to them and sort of the plan for cross marketing.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, a group chat is a good idea. I'll add you to and then tell her so we can use that.

#### Jesse Eisses

Let's do it. If Rachelle and me are both in that group, then we can take on the coordination just to make sure it gets pushed out quickly and we get everything to their side in time.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I think it'll help because coordination wise, we'd want to share it, too, once it's ready.

#### Jesse Eisses

Cool. Sounds good. Nice.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah.

#### Jesse Eisses

So that's clear. I think the proposal has zero.

#### David B

Zero.

#### Jesse Eisses

No files, 24 yes files. So that's good from my side. No questions on the D five box. Like, if we have a group and figure out the next steps, then should be no problem.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. Aside from that, there's pomelo the season is ending today, I think, or rather it's the last 24 hours.

#### Jesse Eisses

Yes. Cool. That's the last day.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. So we were talking about this in the Discord Channel. Is the Dow able to access the EOS in the treasury?

#### Jesse Eisses

No, it's like not directly. So there is no direct link between the Dow smart contract and the treasury because the foundation is sort of the custodian there as there's a lot of funds in. So it's like a multi sick treasury. But the foundation is acting like as a custodian on behalf of the Dow because the funds are from the Dow. So if the Dow decides to change the authority or to change anything or to withdraw funds, that can happen. But it needs to happen through a proposal. So if the Dow basically posts a proposal to extract funds from the treasury, that would be valid way to get funds out. But it's definitely not liquid in that it needs a proposal to get out of the treasury.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Oh, that's fine, because that's how David envisioned it. Right. Well, we'll see how your pitch goes tomorrow. But I don't think you've thus far met any of the goals. So I think it'll go to the next season, right?

#### David B

Probably, yes.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

I didn't reach my goals either, but I think I have enough to create a demo prototype because I kind of well, rather, I think I've been playing around with GPT Four, and it's pretty even better, really, and pretty confident. It can help me build this out pretty quick and then it can continue the kind of like the grand plan, which is with this project, this creates basically a bunch can create data sets for any blockchain starting with EOS. And then afterwards I'll be working on it because Ocean Protocol has their own libraries for uploading data sets to their marketplace. And so my first prototype step would be so I could scan the EOS for all its Nfts, process them using the hugging face models, and then upload this data set to Ocean Protocol. And then I think with that, that becomes very extensible because we could in the future, as a separate project, do more of this data. Perhaps the Dow would fund an Efx grant to pay workers to rate the tags so we can see how good are these tags really? When you look at 100,000 images, are they like 100% accurate, 90% accurate, stuff like that. And then we could post it on Ocean Protocol. And I think that could be a good way both to outreach to Ocean Protocol, show them, hey, we exist, we can do this type of stuff. And also it can kind of be a way to outreach to the AI community as well, showing that we can evaluate models. So I think that's like kind of the goal of what I want to do these next few months.

#### Jesse Eisses

Nice, sounds good. I'm also excited. It sounds like a great product and it would be amazing if you can get it on. If you can get some pipeline working for the basic pipeline and getting it on Ocean. I think that structure would also be really applicable for integrating with Effect Network and doing manual annotations, which I would be very interested in to see if we can get that done from the Dow or to see if we can embed some campaigns in that pipeline once the basics are there. But yeah, good luck. I'm really happy to hear even if you don't reach the goals, that you're still motivated and interested to build the first steps.

#### David B

Indeed. Sounds like you have a pretty solid plan of how you want to continue. I was wondering though, how do you plan on paying for the using hugging phase? Isn't it going to be expensive to do so many queries?

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

No, I can run it locally.

#### David B

Okay.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

I have a 39 DTI, so I think EOS only has 2 million Nfts and of that a lot are duplicates because they're using templates. So I'm pretty confident my hardware can process all of EOS. And then maybe I have enough for wax. Maybe it'll take like a week or something, but I don't have enough hardware to process all the Nfts on ethereum for example. That I think would be too out of scope. But I think I can do EOS and maybe wax.

#### David B

Not cool. I'm very interested to see what the result is going to be and how long it will take.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. And that's also the goal of the with this repo. The idea is you could use your own hardware. You don't have to pay for anything. Well, maybe the elasticsearch instance, that part is kind of unavoidable. If you want to make a demo online, that's unavoidable. But at least getting the data, you can do it all locally because I think that's like a big expense because the GPU instances are very expensive. I think an A 100 is like $2 per hour or something like that, which is insane if you want to run anything for a long time.

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah, cool that you can run it locally, though. That's nice. It's cool. Most models are actually quite affordable to run, I guess, on your own model, which is definitely the way to go if you want to do these types of experiments. All right, so for Pomelo and David Jet, I guess your intention is to just go for the next season and refine the idea with Hugging Face and the integrations and stuff a bit better and then just go for the next season. Right. You're not going to carry this on because it was on behalf of the Dow, but I guess the initiative is from your side, so it's kind of up to you what's happening next. But if I understand what you just said, you're planning on taking it to the next season.

#### David B

Indeed. I do think I want to work a little bit on it in my free time and kind of at least get a basic template started and enter in some test data just to prove it to myself. That how it will look and how it should function for the worker. And later on, I can focus on the meat of the problem of actually hooking up hugging face. But indeed, for now, the meat and potatoes of this whole grant, I'll be moving it up to season six.

#### Jesse Eisses

Nice. Clear. Maybe there's one proposal that I'm writing now that it's not yet published, but I will publish it for the next cycle for the Bank Liquidity Fund, because I missed a few cycles. It was supposed to go in ten batches. We did three right. Now I did miss the payout. Like, I forgot to bridge some of the funds over and put them in. So I did that earlier today because the harvesting wasn't working, because the farm ran low. But I do need to get more funds over. But I wanted to continue on the proposal that was done before about using some of the funds. We skipped a few cycles that had no proposals. There's quite a few funds basically available in those cycles, but because the Dow system, it doesn't account for anything. Like if there's no proposals in a cycle, those funds are basically sort of undefined what happens with them. So now we have aTPS in place. I wanted to make a proposal for basically getting a chunk of the pancake swap rewards by recycling some of those unused cycles. So we have like I don't know, I'm making a small overview, but we have quite a few cycles that have 326,000 Efx that hasn't been used. It should be in the Dow wallet. But because the system wasn't in place to handle those funds, they're currently not. So I wanted to make a proposal for grabbing, say, three of those cycles or a bit less, maybe two and two in a bit or maybe just grabbing two cycles, getting those funds into the wallet of the Dow so we can actually spend them with proposals. So we get some extra budget basically available and creating the ATP to this will be one ATP, of course, with all the actions in it, but then to basically transfer a big chunk for the pancake swap fee so we can catch up and we don't have to keep doing all these cycles. But there was a proposal about this a while back that got approved, I believe. So it's in line with that to basically use those funds of the leftover cycles which now we can finally do neatly with an ATP. So I was going to write that out. Maybe you guys have any inputs on that already? If it makes sense, feel free to comment.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, it makes sense. I think this kind of is similar to the idea you had of kind of revamping the structure of the I remember you were talking about how to make things more efficient to automate.

#### Jesse Eisses

Yes, it comes close to bear the efficiency to automate was mainly that I wanted to stop doing budgets. And actually if you look at what we're doing now, it's already coming close to stop doing budgets because we have the proposal that's accepted now and it's about transferring 230,000 Efx with an ATP. But because it's an ATP, it doesn't have a constraint of budget in there. So it doesn't really recycling policy with the people 70% of the leftovers going to the treasury. That sort of doesn't really work anymore with aTPS anyway unless we make it very complicated. So my proposal for Simplification is to stop using budgets. We just make sure that Dow gets funded from the treasury to the Dow wallet and that's the funding that Dow is available. And there is no per cycle budget anymore. There is an inflow of funds from treasury to the Dow and that's the funds we can use. And then we drop the budget constraints per cycle, which are kind of complicating things and especially the automation part. But this would be the same basically because we're going to grab maybe two leftover cycles and use that to fund the bank export pool which would exceed the cycle budget. But because it's an ATP, we can do it. So yeah, this is sort of a prelude to the next proposal, which would be like that I want to write up a bit more clear, but that will say to drop cycle budgets and just make sure we're going to have the Dow wallet. It has this much liquid funds in it. I'm working on the visualization as well in the new dashboard, the Dow dot affected network where we can visualize this is the amount of funds available in the wallet and that's basically that proposals can use for funding. Right. And then there will be like a sort of a system in place that every two weeks funds from the treasury gets released into the Dow wallet. And instead of doing the I call it complicated because it's kind of complicated, there's some manual steps involved, the recycling of the funds. We could just write a proposal that says, look, we have such a big budget right now in the wallet, we basically want to send some back to the treasury. We could do that if we want to, but I don't think there's going to be a big need for that so that it relates to it. Right, so it will come afterwards. But this proposal that I'm going to make for the current cycle would be mainly just getting quite a big chunk of efx, basically out of the treasury, because we go from the treasury to the Dow wallet and then from the Dow wallet to the Pancakes Up pool. And it would be around I need to do the calculation, but I'm guessing around like 600,000 efx might be a bit more, maybe even 900,000 around that range. Just to fill up most of the remaining pending rewards. Anyway, that proposal will come out like tomorrow.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Then the aTPS go take all from the treasury, right?

#### Jesse Eisses

Well, aTPS can only spend from the Dow wallet, not from the treasury. So from the treasury actually we need.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Dow wallet is Dow proposals.

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah, that's Dow proposals.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Okay, because right now it only has like 82,000 Efx. So where would the 600,000 come from?

#### Jesse Eisses

Let's see, it only has 82,000. So there is another 326,000 coming in for the next cycle which comes in like when the cycle starts. But that's going to be consumed largely by the proposal of the cycle that we have for the D five box campaign. So in order to do the proposal for the 600,000, that would be like basically two cycles worth of going to the bank expense rewards. Those funds would have to come from the treasury as well. But the problem was that they were supposed to be coming from the treasury, but they never were because of there not being any proposals in those cycles. So it's kind of like the treasury, it's part of the Dow, but we also call it out of circulation. So the only way to get it into circulation would be via a proposal to get treasury funds into circulation. And it needs more signatures also from the foundation, for example, to get those funds in currently so that's the extra hassle. So we would need to identify how many cycles were never paid out because there was no proposals. That's going to be an X amount and the Dow would have to vote that it's okay to bring those funds into circulation because they were supposed to. If we decide that's what was supposed to happen because it's kind of undefined behavior what happens when there's no proposals. So it's a bit of a complicated situation that we need to clear anyways. And I guess this is just the start of it to come up with a better simple system for the Dow wallet and the treasury.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

So then the idea is we end recycling and it's more like the treasury is unlocking the 300 what was it? 26,000 efx every cycle.

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah. In the simplified version, what I want to propose in first instance but this will be my proposal for me to discuss with everyone else would be like I think it's better we just say for the next quarter for the next three months, we're going to bring in this amount into circulation for the Dow to use for funding, and that will be approved. We're going to do like a big transaction for basically three months worth of funding. We're going to define the cycles for three months and then that's the funding part. And then the rest will be just ATP spending that funds and how we see fit. Another possible solution would be to give the Dow access directly to the treasury. But it's kind of I don't like the solution because I feel there's just too much at risk. The Dow is being actively developed still with all these updates coming, I feel it's just very risky to give the Dow access to such a big technically like to give technical access to the Dow for such a big chunk. I think it's just from a security perspective, way better to only have and also from a logical perspective, if you look at things that are in circulation and not in circulation, we want them down to have a pacing in how much it can spend over time because that's just a way to pace. Make sure that we have a long runway ahead of us when it comes to the EFiX funding because it's the biggest amount basically, that's currently available that's there in the Dow Treasury. So yeah, my proposal would be we sort of take a time frame like quarterly we transfer quarterly budgets to the Dow's wallet so it's available liquid in the Dow wallet and then the Dow can basically use aTPS to spend that amount fixed for the quarter.

#### David B

Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I'm guessing we can always have a mechanism for emergency situations in order to supplement a quarterly budget if the need ever arises.

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah, we could it's yeah, definitely possible to to like like, for example, now we're we're looking to get 600,000 extra efx in circulation because I want to make the case that it should have been because of the undefined behavior of cycles. It should have been basically remaining in the dow wallet instead of being sent to the treasury. Yeah, you can always make an exception. But the thing is that whatever is in the Dow wallet that sort of liquid that funds to use, they can programmatically be spent by the smart contract. So it means if a proposal approves, these funds get spent. Right. It's really in the decentralized sense, when it comes to the tokens that are not in circulation, we really need approval from more parties in order to bring them into circulation. And it needs to be like an active decision. Like we're going to bring this amount of tokens into circulation so it's not directly spendable via code basically to get into the treasury. And I think that should remain at least for a little while. That should remain like that, I think especially because of the security implications of having that many funds in a smart contract.

#### David B

Yeah, agreed. I can imagine there will be people who will start trying to target it.

#### Jesse Eisses

For sure. Yeah, hackers are going to put more effort into finding weak points if there's funds in there. Right, it's like that's kind of the formula, for sure.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

So then with aTPS, does it then screw up the Governance Rewards calculation?

#### Jesse Eisses

Yes, it does.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

We had the system of like 30%, but I'm wondering if we just from what everything you've told me, it seems like we want to refine it so it's much smoother, less complex and more automated. So why couldn't we just what I'm thinking is basically we increase the budget and make the payment governance Rewards a static amount. And then so like, for example, I think it's 326,000, so we can make it say 74,000. Well, actually there's no real reason to keep it to the 326,000. Maybe we can just say 325,000. I don't know, maybe this is just like a number thing. But anyway so 325,000 for distributed to the Dow proposals wallet as liquid Dow funds to be used either through regular proposals or aTPS and then 75,000 efx distributed as rewards every cycle. Kind of ending that system we had where we kind of had a proportional share and this way we don't need to calculate anything complex. We just distribute the same amount every time.

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah, the 30% actually came from I think that was the first proposal in the dollar that sort of came up with a 30% recycling with kind of 30%, I mean 30% for the goes to the to the to the people. Yeah, definitely. We that was someone came up with that and it was implemented and approved. But yeah, that would be a nice solution to have a static amount, I think way better. Or what I was thinking we could also do it like just embed whenever a proposal is paid out to take it, to add a little of the amount that's paid out maybe 10% goes to the people which is a different mechanic. What it would also be quite easy. That would actually mean that a portion of the funds that are spent that are basically invested into proposals that a proportion of that goes to the people. That would also be possible because we're going to embed it in the aTPS. So you would just get the ATP.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Disalign the incentives there a bit though.

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah, it would change the incentives. For example, it may be more aligned.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Encourage people to kind of like basically the more expensive proposal is it may encourage them to I'm not saying now because there's so few but like a long term thing is we don't necessarily want people to have an incentive to give out more. Right.

#### Jesse Eisses

It depends a bit. Right. You can look at two ways. Like they're also there to be used, I guess right now, we're encouraging people to not vote for proposals because it would give them more fees if there's more leftover. And this would switch it around that we're encouraging people to vote for proposals because they would get a little bit of that. But also there would be a lot of funds if it's a bad proposal there would still be a lot of funds wasted a lot more than you would gain as a fee probably.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I feel though static is the best since the way I see it is just I think it was always intended just to be initial reward and any real rewards would be from the transaction fees.

#### David B

True.

#### Jesse Eisses

The aesthetic is actually I also really like that mechanic. I think maybe even preferred aesthetic reward we would have to think about yeah, I think that could be embedded somewhere or there's no reward is also an option but I don't know that's maybe a controversial one especially as the rewards are still very slim that are coming from other sources than from the cycle. So maybe that won't be appreciated but in the end that would be more ideal to just not spend cycle budgets on Guardian rewards. Maybe but yeah, I guess we have those three options that I would all consider. Maybe the static one is the nicest. Yeah, we can make some estimate what would be a good amount that we would feel comfortable with to go statically to the people but I think it's static or proportion of paid out would be my preferred but in any case I think it will make it more clear and it will be more automated. Just to give you guys a little update because I talked about it in the last out call and I haven't shared any visuals or demo which I was planning on but it's not there so I have to wait a little bit. I did share it with a few people already but I'm working on a few things but I think a nice thing to share with the Dow really soon would be an updated dashboard. I quite some ideas and things I'm implementing that I think will be a really nice update. The primary thing I've done now is to revamp the home page a bit, maybe went a bit deep on that, but just to make the homepage really clear on the current active proposals, proposals that are coming up and the current state of the cycle. So if there's any High Guard action pending, it would show that basically on the front page, the front page would show next upcoming Dow call and here's the agenda and add an item to the agenda like some more sensible information instead of your stake tokens. And then to restructure the menu a bit like the Staking page should show some nice statistics of total amount stake and some graphs and the Dow page should maybe show the High Guard the Dow members profile pictures updated just a bit more sensible. And also the big update would be the ATP forms where you can add different types of transactions for proposals. But it's taking shape so I'm hoping to share that with you guys really soon.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. I know the effect force numbers are kind of like not working right now.

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah, those are removed now. In my version those are removed but.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

It'Ll be nice to have some sort of number because it is all like Lookupable now just need to make the right calls, right?

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah, definitely. So more statistics. I'm going to end up with a big list, I think, of cool things but yeah, we could get I am visualizing in the new version the current cycle and how many fees came from effect for us and how many fees are currently that will be distributed in this cycle. But it will be cool to have some statistics on tasks on users and we can get those now from the blockchain. So it's a good point but because it's broken I removed it and definitely cool to add that as well.

#### David B

Hopefully that will attract a lot more Dow members to come back and be more engaged.

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah, I hope so. I just wanted to give that quick update. I have to leave now actually. I have to jump out of the call but I just wanted to give that quick update. Yeah, I'm excited, like when I have something to show we can, I think, have more in depth discussions on features to add and work on that roadmap. I had a good call with W today to discuss some of the longer term planning on things we want to start promoting and building and this is one of them as well. So yeah, it's going to come soon.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

All right. Yeah, it's too bad you have to leave. Yeah, I wanted to ask about the hackathon and stuff like that. I don't know if you've looked into Dora hacks yet.

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah, I would love to discuss the hackathon. I have to. Really go in like two or three minutes. But Dora hacks, I've only briefly looked at it. I looked really good, actually. I was quite impressed or impressed and I didn't see anything wrong with it. I looked really attractive to use. I don't think it's that expensive either. I wasn't sure about the pricing, but yeah, sounds like a great option.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I think I guess as a quick idea to think about is because I've been advocating that we get ready for the EOS EVM and they did a hackathon for the EOS EVM. So we could just try to figure out a way, maybe talk with them or talk with whoever so that we can have just like because the last hackathon we did, most people used the Binet Smart chain. Right. Because it's easy. And I assume it's going to be the same case with EOS EVM where you can just use made a mask. And so that could be a good way to get a lot of interest from EOS developers to build something and also have a good hackathon in general.

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah, true. Really interesting to see if we can embed EVM. So I'm planning I don't have to clear my head how that looks, but I think there are definitely many ways. Just having Metamask use ePM integration would be a minimal cool thing to have before the hackathon, so we can attract participants from the EVM side. But it's really to have a cool, like a Bridging system or like a more integrated part. I think there's a lot of options we could investigate, but I still have to try to see what we can do. I do have to jump out now, so sorry. Let's talk about the hackathon in Discord and on the next call. But yes. See you guys soon.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Bye, Jesse.

#### David B

See you.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Bye bye.

#### David B

I'm also looking forward for the hackathon. I think it will be a good idea to to bring some more attention back again for people to build on the stock.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I think there's a lot of developers on EOS. It's pretty competitive on Pomelo, but I think just getting acquainted with all of them, it's good word of mouth for when we have a hackathon to kind of see if we can encourage them to join. And then with EOS EVM, it kind of gives them an incentive to encourage it as well because they want Dapps on EOS EVM. So I think there's a lot of mutual gain that can happen if we act right on that.

#### David B

Indeed. One of the big cons that I had in my mind of using Death Post again was that it was very.

#### Jesse Eisses

Expensive.

#### David B

Which did help us get in touch with a larger audience compared to usual. But I do think now we'll be able to draw upon those EOS developers. Those are the ones that we would like to attract. It's also a lot more clear in my mind which communities we can engage and advertise to let them know that we will be having a hackathon soon.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. Hopefully we can get really good Dapps because you don't necessarily need hundreds of people. You just need the very motivated people.

#### David B

Exactly. And I do notice that people will come as well if they see an opportunity where there is some money on the table and there isn't a lot of competition vying for that money that people will then try to fill in that niche.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Right. I guess we covered everything in this Dow call.

#### David B

I think so too. If there wasn't anything else you wanted to talk about.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

No, I think that covers it all for me. Good luck on your pitch tomorrow.

#### Jesse Eisses

Yeah, thanks.

#### David B

Will you also be pitching tomorrow?

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

No, I pitched on the one. First one.

#### David B

Okay. Yeah, I'm curious to see how it's going to be. Thanks. I should manage.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I think it will do well. All right then we'll talk again on discord in the next Dow call.

#### David B

Will do. Have a good one.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

You too. Bye.
