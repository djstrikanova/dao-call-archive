## Assembly AI Generated Summary + Edits

* Effect and Effect Network should outreach to the rest of the EOS community. A bounty board could be a great way to outreach to find developers that can build stuff for the DAO. Could also integrate EOS EVM on the other hand. Could take a while before they manage to implement that.
* David: I would be interested somewhat in marketing a bit more to developers. I think I need to have a meeting about marketing where we can put it onto a level that I can approach. Also we should start planning the next hackathon.
* dorahacks.io is worth investigating as a hackathon venue
* Rochelle needs more validation task workers, send a message to her to join

## Generated Transcript

DJSTRIKANOVA

All right, so I guess we can start my proposal. I'm glad that it's pretty unanimous thatal agrees that we should outreach to the rest of the EOS community. I've been joining their Fireside chats. They're actually also like on Wednesdays every week at 02:00 P.m. Central time for me, which is I think like seven. I'm not going to say what time it's in other times, but anyway, yeah, Pamela is also in the last Fireside chat I learned that they're going to have bounties like a bounty board. And so I think that could be a good way for Effect and Effect Network to outreach. We could kind of cross post Bounties on there and that could maybe entice because Pomelo is like basically a sense like the way I see Pomelo. All sorts of developers on EOS go there seeking grant funding, but they also have development skills. Right. So a bounty board could be a great way to outreach to find developers that Dow can build stuff for us.

David

Absolutely, I totally agree. I will also be there tonight at the Fireside chat. I can introduce myself and get to know the EOS community. But I agree that like we should reach out to Palmello and also post our Bounties there. And yes, it's very encouraging to see that the rest of the Dow is also supporting your proposal.

Bree

Well, I feel like it's a perfect union at this point. EOS has spent like the EOS Foundation has spent the last year trying to build itself up, become something revitalized and new and not what it was and Effective Network has essentially been in the same position and both are now ready to move forward.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, they have a log on the pipeline as you said, they're branding the new EOS. They're building out an EVM. So I don't know if it's possible maybe something on the long term to also because we have the relayer, I wonder if it could be adapted to EOS's EVM because I imagine they'd really like people to endorse it. So they basically state it's one of the fastest EVMs, but you still need to have apps on there and entice people to go there. So I think if we endorse the EVM could be a good way to outreach as well to the other rest of the community.

David

One of the reasons we adopted the relayer and went to added the token to BSE was in order to be able to integrate many masks support. So on one hand that would be really helpful. We can also integrate the EOS EVM on the other hand. Yes, I'm not sure how that would work with tokenwise if we would need to support one more token on their EVM as well. Or if we can use we would have to use existing tokens on the EOS with the EVM.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, the EVM would be EOS based so they would have like the specific swap design for EOS. So it's like interchangeable between EOS and the EOS EVM, but yeah, all other tokens would need like another provider. So we'll have to lean on P tokens or something like that.

David

Could take a while before they manage to implement that as well within their own ecosystem.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, we'll have to just wait and see what they have planned. I'm hoping that because there's also the Env, which is like basically the Env is like an investment type fund. So the ENF provides grants but these are open source based and generally it's expected to provide open source software. It's not like they expect the return on investment, but with EMV they do. But we'll see what happens because from the Fireside chats that I've attended, it hasn't really been really hashed out to what they want it to do except in the most abstract way of investing to attract developers and stuff like that. But I'm hoping they kind of because they also have the Antelope update to EOSIO right, and it's not fully complete yet, but I feel like once they're ready they would want to incentivize people to update their codes and roll out everything. I mean, I'm just hoping that they support all the existing applications on the OS so they can have great integrations with their EVM.

David

Yeah, I hope so. I'm thinking one of the reasons they want to support the EVM on EOS is because there are so many contracts written for them, the EVM, and they're hoping that developers will port over all of their codes from then other EVM chains onto EOS.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, definitely. This is where I think we can make our pitch as just as a Dow and in fact network in general is that you can port all of that but you still need to attract the users. Right. And with effect network the tasks I think would be a great way to attract users because there's a lot of people who are interested in doing, working and earning crypto as It. And for EOS, creating an account has always been a major barrier. It's like when I look at the smart contracts, I noticed that generally of the accounts that are created a lot are made a mask, like from binary smart chain because I think it's just so much easier to make an account we've made a mask than generate a whole new EOS wallet. I think over the next few months we just have to I advocate participating in the US community once the next season rolls out. I know David wants to have his dad as a grant and then I don't know if I'm still hashing out like my translation depth ideas with Abdulmad. Like maybe I'll just make something even simpler. But other than that, I think for proposals I'll endorse my favorite grants and other downloaders should feel like they can do the same or otherwise maybe entice the grant developers to make a pitch as well. But yeah, I hope to kind of be active and show I hope we can show off that this Dow can also support developers as well. Of course, within everyone's means. But I think I'm going to convert some of my rewards into EOS and then provide it to some grants. Yeah, just to show like, we can be active and support the EOS community.

David

Indeed. Yeah, I totally agree. That's why I also think we should just be more vocal of the EOS community on our own social channels as well, so that show our support and to show that we are an active member of the EOS community and also show them that we're interested in seeing the ecosystem grow.

Bree

I'll make sure to pop in some EOS information into the TG chat.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yes. There's also the I think did you on Telegram there is a group for the Antelope devs. They want like a roundtable. You should join that as well, David, if you haven't already.

David

Yeah, I think I'm in that channel. Yes.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I think they're trying to set something up because I mean, Effect Network is actually like heavily, like, uses the EOS IO. Right. So it's important as people who've used the features you want, like, you can request them.

David

Okay. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah. There are definitely some features here and there that I think on one hand we would need to support ourselves or already integrate with existing features where we would need to update versions and or indeed ask for more features.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Anything else we'd like to discuss?

Bree

Yes, but I can't think of any right now. Who was it? I'm going to go back in and check something right back.

Rochelle

Well, I do have something to discuss. I am readying validation tasks for Dow members to complete. So I'm going to ask Gangsta a couple of weeks ago, but if anyone wants in on these exclusive Dow tasks, I need you to send me a DM in Telegram or Discord. Let me know your worker ID and I'll give you a special qualification. I just need a small group of people who want to do some tasks and small group of people I can trust. So this is part of that pilot program for the Dow validation stuff that I'm still hashing out. So I have things ready. First, we'll be validating Twitter likes and retweets to make sure the people are doing that because it takes a long time to manually go through a spreadsheet. But if I pop them up as tasks, then everyone can all work together and get them done quickly. And there's like one line of code with this template that I've been so frustrated on. My head is like, walk away. So I gave it to David and he's looking at it for me with my new coding skills. Yeah. So if you're interested in doing tasks and you are a Dow member and want to do only validation, give me a shout. That was it for my update.

Bree

Okay.

David

I'll have some for you, Rochelle, for the template.

Rochelle

Oh, Rush, thank you. I labeled my file as frustration when I sent it because I'm just so annoyed with it.

Bree

How is Gaby doing?

Rochelle

Great.

Bree

Okay. I haven't noticed her presence on the social media at all.

David

She was away for a while, but she's back now. She's back now.

Bree

Okay. I think what I need more is a meeting with Gabby than anything.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Just about some marketing on the marketing committee.

Bree

I know. Yeah.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I can schedule a talk between everyone, I guess.

Bree

Is anyone here interested in that area other than Rochelle? She's into everything.

David

Yeah, I would be interested somewhat in marketing a bit more to developers.

Bree

Yeah. I don't know anything about marketing to developers, but I do think we could right now I can't remember his name. He's like we should be doing a push to pancake swap, like a little marketing push. And he's not wrong. Right now is a good time to just throw a few out there, but maybe there's a few other things we can throw out there or tap into that social score.

David

Yeah, absolutely. When it comes to marketing, bank takes you up a bit more. I think that not necessarily what I had in mind. I had in mind more well, no, for you snippets on the social media channels in order to attract developers and showing them how to use the SDK, really simple code snippets or memes that involve our technology and to kind of entice people to start using ours.

Bree

Maybe you could give us some hashtags for developers that would be more effective than just putting dev or hash developer.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I think with attracting developers, it's going to have to be I think it could be more positioned where I think we could look at the grant people on Pamela and see if they have to go through that way socials and just like see if they could be interested. I know, for example, in Telegram we discussed with the EOS, I don't know if it's EOS or like Zeus, I don't know how to pronounce it, but I know they are looking for funding from ENFP. So I don't know if maybe attracting developers is just a tricky because you can't just post an ad, right. That's not going to be that useful. You have to give them like I think maybe the bounty board would be better for this.

Bree

Well, I think we could use some brain hashing. Even if it's just for my own head. To get my head into that particular side of things, I think I need to have a meeting about marketing where we can put it onto a level that I can approach.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I think also we should start planning the next hackathon.

Bree

Oh, hell yeah.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Because I think one of our strongest when we outreach, I think the strongest is just showing what adapts people can build using the Ffjs and stuff like that.

Bree

Yeah. And even for the next hackathon is like, hey, we already have some samples, now beat this.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Exactly.

Bree

This is what we consider strong.

DJSTRIKANOVA

So I don't know. What do you feel about that, David?

David

Yeah, I agree. I think the timing of the previous hackathon was a bit of a misfire where we weren't ready yet in order to maintain the momentum. And I think now we're really ready for a big hackathon and where at the end of the hackathon people can really properly launch on main net and we can properly support them and building out their DAPs and getting workers and helping them build their qualifiers and curate their workforce. So I think now we're really ready. My big concern is getting an audience to help us because previously when we did it on Deaf post we did manage to get quite a bit of traction but it was also quite expensive.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Right.

David

I'm hoping that we would be able to engage some other community instead of using Deaf Post.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. I have a thread for hackathon sites and there's also Dora hacks which I think with the EOS EVM it used to be called the Trust EVM. Maybe not, but I know like some EOS project did. Our hackathon on Dora hacks is it called DoraHacks? Make sure I get the name right.

David

I have a couple of ideas and I would love to build them. Yeah.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Dorhex IO. Yeah. And they're also like themed tours, crypto. So I think we should definitely see if we can get into contact with them and look into it.

Rochelle

I was on Hash Note the other day and I noticed there's like hackathon areas too on there. I'll explore that more when I'm in there later today.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. On these venues, it's only because of their size that they can charge that big monthly fee, but I think the smaller ones, the fee is much more reasonable and with that we can focus on having more of an EFX price pool. I think it will be better if we have us like the first hackathon we had, it was a pretty big price pool. Right. I think we can reduce the price pool to maybe, I guess like $20,000 worth in EFX and maybe some combination like other tokens and then with that we can get some more activity without breaking the bank or treasury.

David

Yes, exactly. Like I was also hoping that the payout would be done in EFX instead of doing it in the USPT. That would really help and hopefully now that the EU community is up and coming again and that we're engaging with them, we can really manage to also use those channels a bit in order to spread the word about our upcoming hackathon.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Right. We could outreach to them. And I think a lot of the people seeking grants will definitely be open to building some DAP for a chance to I think for our price bowl, we should kind of I like the idea of having a big so there can be lots of winners because we want, like, a variety of DAPs and we also have the NFX as well. I don't know if that was transferred yet, but that can also be another source.

Bree

There could be different category winners.

David

Instead.

Bree

Of an overall everybody's under one category, you can have the top three in different categories.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, we'll have to make sure there's not so many prizes that it's greater than the competitors, but I guess we'll just have to I think you can relate to David and Lawrence that we should definitely look into door hacks. It doesn't have to be super big price pool wise. And we can outreach to the EOS community on the Fireside chats and stuff like that. Once we have it set up and once we have that, we'll have the apps being built out and we can brag about it on the Twitter and stuff. And I think that's like, people, like with crypto, people are tired of promises. I think people just want deliverables and tangible code and I think this will be the best way to do it.

Bree

Well, it's time to get working on the hack bomb. It's time to just increase that social presence a little bit more in a few areas and some connections with EOS with the hackathon.

DJSTRIKANOVA

We could also invite EOS community members to be judges as well.

Bree

Oh yeah. What about tapping into the DNB community?

DJSTRIKANOVA

I don't know, for me it seems trickier. I haven't really dived too much into it.

David

It feels a lot more speculative than less of a builder culture.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Okay, there may be like builders, but I don't know where to go for it.

Rochelle

For me, if we're trying to get bigger visibility in the EOS community and stuff, and we've already told them no, we didn't go to BSc, we just use that as a way for token exchange and easy onboarding of some workers and things. But everything's still on EOS. I don't really want to be talking about BSc a lot and making a big splash over there trying to well.

DJSTRIKANOVA

We already tried it anyway, right? I don't think we really had much success, I mean, aside from usage, it's success, but we didn't really attract much interest in building, which I think is tricky. I mean, even the pancake swapped in, I don't know what happened, but I think even after we end the farm, we could also consider other pools as well. I don't know, like pancake swap. Well, I think part of it is because we're just a small crypto, right? Hard to get attention, but yeah, I think as Rochelle said, I think we should definitely focus more on EOS side and also I think in the long term, because this is a question I have for you, David do you think possible in the long run for the qualifications to be like incorporate NFTs in it?

David

Yeah, I remember that question. I thought I answered it. So I think on one hand I like the idea of the qualifications being NFPs, but I also think that you shouldn't be able to sell them or they should be NFPs on one hand where you can lose them, but then you don't need the NFD feature in order to be able to lose them. So I do think the implementation that we have right now is the right one. Even though we don't get the hype of NFT qualification.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Well, I'm not thinking necessarily that it has to be NFT based, more like it's compatible with NFTs. So for example, a way to outreach could be like these people have the specific campaign, right? And they want to have a specific type of workers who have this NFT. They can just use that as a means to build the workforce instead of like for example, let's say all those image collection NFTs. Right. What if they want to create a campaign specifically for people who own that one of those sets of images? Right. That way it could be a way to integrate them for qualifications without having.

Bree

Any it sounds like you're talking about the badges.

DJSTRIKANOVA

The what?

Bree

It sounds like you're talking about the badges, but instead of a badge it's an NFT that's given.

David

Yeah, that's right. Now they're presented as badges. But those are qualifications.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Basically. Yeah. What I'm thinking of is how can we on the Fireside chats I've learned of there's a lot of dials on EOS. There's the EOS support, which has their own dow called EOS Respect. There is Eden on OS, I think it was called Hyperion Dow or something like that. So I feel like that in the future it could potentially be useful because we ultimately want to attract people who should just use effect JS. Right. And I feel like right now the development side of Camp, like the requester side is pretty good. But I think the worker management side needs improvement because right now if you create a requesting campaign, you're kind of dependent on the worker side being done by the Dow or the worker's already being there. Right?

David

Yes.

DJSTRIKANOVA

There's a lot of NFT trading communities and stuff like that. So I was just thinking like maybe it's just like a feature request in the long term to consider that to have it possible for I guess well, maybe it already is, I don't know. Would you be able to do a qualification that it checks for the NFT?

David

Yeah, absolutely. And maybe in the long run, like if we become even more decentralized. But I don't think it's very useful to be able to have the feature where you can send your qualification to somebody else and we'll send it back to you, like when they're done with it. I think it's kind of useful that the requester is the one that's in control of the qualification and I think you kind of lose that feature when you turn the qualification into an NFT.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Well, I'm not saying all qualifications should be NFTs. It's just an option for those that have communities based on NFTs. Like, for example, do you remember, like, the Neuro friend's guys, right? They had their meme images, right? And so what if they wanted to do a campaign, but only they who owned NFTs can do it, right?

Rochelle

It's possible already.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. So if it's possible, I feel like we could use more samples because I know the DAP labor is very good.

Rochelle

Yeah, it's possible already. But it comes down to, okay, say I am Neuropathy and I put up a campaign attached and I only want my community members to be able to do them. So I just tell my community members, hey, make your Effect account and tell me the worker ID that you have with your Effect account. And then I collect all those IDs. They're my community members. And then I mass assign everyone's IDs that I have with the qualification. And then on my campaigns, I require that qualification. That way my tasks can go up. I can post them whenever I want, but only my community members can access them. Like, everyone on the force can see them, but only my people can do them.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, that works when you have the small community, but it's not scalable. I think you wouldn't want to do that process manually for like 200 people.

Rochelle

Yeah. The only issue I see is if there was a qualifier that would check wallet addresses for certain NFTs and then assign those wallet addresses a qualification, then it also would need to be able to check it all the time and then remove that qualification. Like if someone has the NFT in their wallet, then the bot sees they have it, they get the qualification, then they sell the NFT or give the NFT to another friend and that friend gets a qualification. They still have one even though they don't have the NFT anymore. I don't know. For me, I've dealt a lot in the past with workers selling accounts that had certain qualifications and I don't know, to me, there'd have to be a really sophisticated system in place. If we had qualifications tied with NFT.

Bree

They could be like trophies, achievement awards.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Well, I'm just thinking of ways to integrate other communities as, like, potential workforces.

Bree

I see a way to entice.

DJSTRIKANOVA

For example, they want to build requests for their own community and have it be really easy to do. So another idea I was thinking is, for example, there's various dows, right? And for you, you're doing dow validation, the manual way. If there could be like, just a script that checks that your account is part of the dow, that's more like.

Bree

An Identifier than a qualifier.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I think that's a good way to put it. A way to show an identity of what you're active in.

Rochelle

Maybe. Okay, you know how marketeers have their referral links and it tracks the people who signed up under them. I wonder if there's a way to do such a thing with the link where it says join the workforce, but then anyone who clicks that special join the workforce link that's tied with a certain community, then anyone who joins the workforce under that link gets a certain qualification.

Bree

I think it would have to be deeper than just the join level. It has to be inside somewhere. So they join with their account and then their account can be identified with multiple communities by putting in code or by whatever.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Speaking of that, I was also thinking of like referrals in general because we know requesters requester side, they can add on their own fee, right, they have the campaign, but under DAP they can add like an extra fee that goes to them. Right?

Bree

Yeah.

DJSTRIKANOVA

But then the worker side for now we don't have any way to reward people for attracting workers. Right?

Rochelle

Yeah. There's not really a big push for workers to onboard in masses, right yet.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, right now, no, because we need requesters more than workers, which is right.

Rochelle

I've never in all of my years micro tasking ever seen referral rewards for attracting more people to the platforms. And that's something like workers don't want to because they want a small amount of workers because that means they have more access to tasks, they don't have to compete as much.

Bree

Right, but what if any of them, worker or developer, were to refer requesters, even if they themselves weren't a requester.

Rochelle

On a centralized system? Yeah.

David

I love the idea of using NFCs in some way in order to engage that community. I think for sure we should figure out what the features of an NFC would be able to really complement what we have. Either it be the worker of the month, some kind of reward, essentially fund qualifications that we can give workers that are just that just some kind of token that we can give them and on some kind of referral system. I think that would be interesting. Yeah. I'm not sure what that would look.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Like for NFTs in the metadata. Couldn't you just put like the account name so then if people trade, it would still have the original account? So if you have someone else's original NFC, then you can make a check for it?

David

Yeah, that could circumvent it for what account?

Rochelle

The Effect account or the EOS account or the BSc wallet address?

DJSTRIKANOVA

Well, I assume every V account like somewhere it has it written, which here's the thing, I don't know if this system could ever work with BSE. It would have to be EOS based, but with the EOS it would be like in the NFT encoded is the EOS account of the worker when it's generated. And so that way even if you trade it, you can do a check to make sure that the person who owns the account that owns the NFT has the same account as in the NFT, it stated and if it doesn't pass this check then it's invalid.

Bree

Yeah, then that person just gave away their qualification.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, they may have given it away, but they're worthless unless you have the same name.

Bree

Right, but that's just the person who owned the NFP needs to know that very clearly that if they sell it, that qualification is gone.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, this is just how to implement.

David

Yes, there might be something there, but I'm still kind of dubious about building something like that because I think what we have right now is a solid basis and we should continue building on that. And afterwards we can take a look at and yeah, I agree with some kind of NFD functionality.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I agree with that assessment. I'm just thinking out loud because basically I'm thinking like on the EOS you have people who want to work and maybe they could on board requesters as a way for them to earn the money like EOS support for example, they're on standby doing support tickets. I very much imagine they would be definitely down doing other effect network tasks and because they're active like community members, maybe they could entice developers to build campaign ain't specific for them for tasks. Only the US support Dow can do something like that. That's like the general idea I'm having.

David

Yeah, that might be interesting. I was thinking of other kinds of DAPs where for example, you would have an extension and for example, with Cookie popups you would send a link then as a task and where like people, the workers would then like click through, then the cookie popups in order to kind of give an indication what are the things that you need to click, and that would kind of be fed back into some kind of system where the system would always reject or accept the pop ups of the cookies somehow. That's something more I have in mind that would be really useful for someone or to add to some kind of data set. Yeah, that's just ultimately thinking of that.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I think the only really thing I suggest we do need for now is because Rochelle stated like adding the workforce. You still do that like for blocks, right?

Rochelle

Yeah, I still use blocks for adding qualifications and removing them.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, at least on the force front end. It will be nice to have a management system to just do what Rachel is doing in a nice easy way.

Rochelle

Yeah, that's something we want to do for the UI update.

David

But I agree especially now that slowly but there are more tasks, there are more workers, we need a better way to do validation and manage the workers and that's something that we need to build out now because that part isn't there at the moment. Did any of you catch, by the way, when the. Next formula season starts. I'm thinking it's going to be in the second week of February.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I don't know any date, but yeah, it does seem like February. It seems like it's interesting. It seems like some people abuse tried the way the grant system is designed. They scanned for what is called civil attacks, which is, I guess, people generating new accounts to vote and impact the quadratic grant funding. And so I think some people or some grants have been disqualified for breaking the rules. And so I think that's why they're kind of been taking longer. But yeah, I think in February it seems like it's going to happen soon.

David

Okay, that's good to know. I wish I could at least kind of already register and create a ground on Palmer instead of waiting until the season opens. That way I could at least start prepping for it.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, well, I think we don't have too much long here to wait.

Bree

Why do you have any.

DJSTRIKANOVA

What?

Bree

Why do you have to wait to start prepping it?

David

Because I would like to see what the registration form looks like and what are the parameters that they want and what kind of information they want and so that I could start drafting bits and pieces. Of course, I've already started drafting it for myself, but it's nice to know what the parameters are.

Bree

Yeah. Okay.

David

So the Fireside Chat is going to be in 2 hours, right?

DJSTRIKANOVA

Let's see. Every week, 3 hours, I think.

Rochelle

Yeah, it should be 09:00 P.m for you, Debbie, I think.

David

Okay, perfect.

DJSTRIKANOVA

If you're on Discord EOS, you can click the event. It should tell you the time.

Rochelle

Is that every week? Yeah.

Bree

Is that twitter or discord?

Rochelle

Well, EO support does both discord and no. They do Twitter and YouTube, I think.

DJSTRIKANOVA

That just streams it, though.

Rochelle

Yeah, that's the stream and that's the one like if you do, like, the live answer quizzes to get NFT reward.

Bree

Okay, so it's in Discord then?

Rochelle

Yeah, if you go to the community Discord, it's got all the links and info form on the events part.

Bree

Yeah. Okay. I probably can put it on like, a radio today the house clean and day.

David

Okay. Yeah, found it. Sweet, thanks. Well, I think I'll see you there. I need to do groceries now, so I'm going to leave.

DJSTRIKANOVA

All right. I think we covered what we wanted to for this week.

Bree

Yeah, I can't think of anything. I just need to connect with Gabby.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I guess. Until next time then.

David

All right. I'll see you at the fireside chat.

Bree

Bye, everyone.

David

Thanks. You too. Have a good one. Bye.
