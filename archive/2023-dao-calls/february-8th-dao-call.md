{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHDKweGG5VE" %}

## Assembly AI Generated Summary + Edits

* DJSTRIKANOVA: Socials tab, I'll post the bounties once the cycle ends. The other one is just a call to increase liquidity on Defibox. I'd like more to go to Defibox because that just increases our visibility in the ecosystem. Bree
* Martin from .gems stopped by and discussed collaboration over emojis and stickers for Effect Discord server, and other things such as having Effect Updates in EOS news feed.
* Bree: Our server can support 250 custom emojis and like 60 custom stickers. I'm going to get my sketchbook up, start drawing ideas up. We need a lot it'll make more colorful the discord and broaden our connections with EOS community.
* Jesse: I'm excited about the proposal DJ put up about putting more rewards available for the Defibox pool from PancakeSwap. It's good to see the liquidity increasing there at the moment. Nice to see it more visible, but would be better if it was seen on Coinmarketcap and Coingecko
* DJSTRIKANOVA: Yeah. Generally the Pancakeswap fees aren't that much because the volume for EFX hasn't been that high until recently. Right now it's more significant. So it's probably worth looking into.
* Pomelo Grant applications are opening on the 22 February

## Generated Transcript

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, the first one was the socials tab, so I'll post the bounties once the cycle ends. Well, not the bounties, the issue on GitHub. I think since we're reaching out to EOS, I feel like it's not like to have just like a social tab where we can have some links both to our discord and dial telegram and then also to the other EOS stuff like the EOS discord, the Pamela Telegram and their sites.

Bree

Yeah, absolutely.

David B

Yeah. That would be interesting. If anything. I'm not sure if that's still the case, but it would be nice to look to other sites as well.

Bree

Yeah. You got another one up?

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. And the other one is just the next two, I guess, are related. So the ones still processing about to pass is just a call to increase liquidity on defy box. I think we did pretty well. If you look at it at the current price, it's about 73,000 EOS bilateral death, which I think is pretty good, I think. I guess after a volatility goes on, maybe after a week or two, I think I'll go and ask them about how to set up some sort of mutual farm there. Potentially they have box rewards and we have EFX, though I think I'll be publishing not this cycle but the next cycle, a sentiment on whether the rest of the dow wants to have another farm or kind of use the same rewards we use for the pancake and just kind of plan to kind of change it out. Yeah. Like for example, so the pancake swap farm ends in, I think, September. And so if, let's say it's 100% pancakes swap right now, but what if we said that 66% goes to pancake swap and then 33% goes to like, the five box or something like that? That's an option.

Bree

I think people might be more open to that because then there's no bottom line adjustment.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. Alternatively, we can just have another second farm. So I think I'll just put two proposals and we'll see which one is most popular.

Rochelle

I'd like more to go to D five box because then that just increases our visibility in the ecosystem. The US. Ecosystem.

Bree

Yes. And did anyone else see the notice on DFI box about them basically thinning out pairings that didn't have a high enough liquidity?

DJSTRIKANOVA

What do you mean?

Bree

Like if they didn't have a million tokens?

DJSTRIKANOVA

I think that was like for another thing because I know they have other programs there.

David B

Okay, was it for EFX or was.

Bree

It for no, it wasn't specific to anyone. It was just sort of a heads up. We're going to start removing pairs if they don't meet this criteria.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Oh, there's more. These are for the dot jams.

Bree

Yeah, I'm not sure NFX fit that criteria. I think there's more than what they were stating on that. My memory is still bad right now. I have it in front of me.

DJSTRIKANOVA

To really hey, martin, go ahead.

Martin Breuer

I wasn't speaking. I just didn't want to interrupt the conversation. We had a little back and forth on Twitter, and I saw that you're having a community Dow call, so I just wanted to chime in. And if there are any questions or if the sticker thing is urgent for you guys, then I can talk to my team and get this going. But it would take some more time for us to do the proposal ourselves and get all that, like, formal way going, I think. I'm not sure how urgent this is.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, it's not like I don't think it's super urgent. It's more like I just wanted to establish a relationship with, I guess, a creative agency such as yours that's on the US platform, which I think is perfect.

Bree

Excuse me, Martin B? Could you introduce yourself? I don't know where you are.

Martin Breuer

Yes, I should start with this. Hi, guys. I'm Martin. I've been working in the US community since Mainet. I've been with EOS Nation. I've been leading their teams in Asia for the last five years. And two or three years ago, I started to also found Gems as a Web Three marketing and community engagement company, and we're working with ENF. We're doing most of their community events like the Fireside Chat, where digital Striker Nova is joining. Since months now, almost all the time. I've been also since Effect Network moved over to EOS, been a token holder, and also started staking and participating, like, at least staking in the Dow structure. I really liked things that you brought to the table, like the age thing and the dual token mechanics, but due to time constraints, that didn't really get too deep into the governance of Effect Network. But I'm following on stuff. I'm based in Germany, so it's not far away from Amsterdam. Yeah, that's basically it.

Bree

Any questions? That's very cool.

Martin Breuer

Hi, Bree.

Rochelle

Hi. Welcome back.

Martin Breuer

Yeah, come again.

David B

It's good to see the work that you've been doing.

Martin Breuer

Yeah, likewise. I'm excited that we can weave together and come together again in bringing the EOS Community forward and the applications that are running on it. So happy to help. I got the go to help you guys out from the rest of the team. And, yeah, we just need to figure out the scope and the timeline and come up with ideas, because I think your community knows best. What kind of icons you want to have as kind of stickers who are something that we do for the NF, for example, we like the most popular EOS community members. We turn them into little cartoons. We also do animated icons for some of the most popular apps. We could include, like, Effect Network, for example, in this initiative to have you featured in the EOS Community, Discord, Sticker Pack, these kind of things, I think we can really align our interests.

Bree

So you could turn me into a little icon because everyone would want that course.

Martin Breuer

Turn you into a little icon?

Bree

Yeah, sure.

Martin Breuer

Design wise, this would take a little bit of time. I think we need to come up with kind of concept that it's all one style, that it all kind of comes across as one collection and yeah, whoever would be my point of contact, we can start this discussion then and then formulate this a little bit into a proposal and then get the approval from the Dow.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Okay, yeah. I set up a thread for anyone who wants to like I guess if anyone has any idea of something that they want and turn into like an emoji or sticker, they can post it in the gym's. Creative thread I made in the general.

Bree

I think our icon, our logo needs to be utilized and created into a little character or something.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, like Rochelle, if you have a link to all the assets, I think.

Rochelle

Effect Networkbrand okay, yeah, I got a.

Bree

Link to all that saved on my computer.

Martin Breuer

Perfect.

David B

That sounds like it would be very useful to us in order to kind of appeal to the broader community. Are there any possibilities as well to join other channels or join other chats in order to spread the message about the Fact Network?

Martin Breuer

You mean on the US Community discord or any discord. Yeah, sure. One thing, currently I'm most active on the US community Discord. There are some other Dowels, like the Eden Community, which is also based on us. They are the USB, which are very active as kind of grassroots marketing company. They have their own discord. They're basically doing something similar. Like, I think you guys were doing Effect Socials, which is like grassroots marketing people. Hey, retweet redo this. So they also have some tools that might be helpful for you. At least they see something that's aligned. And I think everybody is excited about what you guys were doing in the background. This looks good. I'm happy to help you guys out. Getting featured in other Discords, I think generally, like, what DJ Strike Inova is doing, just joining the Fire Saturday every Wednesday is already bringing you way back on the map. I hear more people getting curious about affected eye. It's just about like the numbers at the moment. The more people come in, the more people share. The updates would be interesting. And also, I'm not sure if you already plugged in into the US community news. So we have on the US community Discord, we have bought basically scraping from all the affiliated projects into our news feed. That's something we could start doing.

DJSTRIKANOVA

That would be great if we could have Effect updates there as well.

Martin Breuer

Yeah, for sure. But that's something we can get on a call if you want with Yana. Yana is the one that's managing the discord for us. I'm mostly navigating and communicating with the creatives on our team, but it's all short kind of connections that we can put together.

Bree

I can help out with the stickers.

Martin Breuer

You can help us with basically brainstorming the concepts, the creative concepts for these stickers.

Bree

Yeah, that's my jam. It's more of the creative think tank. Somebody else implements it and creates it.

Martin Breuer

Okay. Is this breed that's you?

Bree

Yeah.

Martin Breuer

Okay, perfect.

Bree

I'll join that. I'll add my thoughts to Rochelle's thread that she created.

Martin Breuer

To what again?

Bree

Rochelle created a thread in our discord about that.

Martin Breuer

I see Gems Creatives as a threat here in general. Is there another threat?

Bree

Okay. The gems discord. Right. I should join that.

Martin Breuer

You can join that, yeah. I will also add you as a friend here in Discord, I think.

Bree

Okay.

David B

That sounds fantastic. Indeed. DJ has been really trailblazing our connection back with the youth community and inspiring us to also be a bit more involved within that. It will be there more often, and yeah. I would like to talk to Yana and figure out how we can connect to the socials a bit.

Martin Breuer

Yeah. I think it will be an ongoing process. I would like to do the regular updates that we're getting from Striker Nova are already good. I will dig a little bit deeper. I see that you continued having the different brands, like the Doubt, that translate to socials captions and pieces. Would you like to have logos for all of these? Like, stickers for all of these, or are you more interested in just the general one?

Rochelle

We don't do the pieces anymore.

Bree

I would say start with the general one and then get that implemented, and then we can work on others.

Martin Breuer

Okay.

Bree

Especially as other gaps start to get established, we can start doing figures for those.

Martin Breuer

Yeah. I think a great way to engage with the community is offering your services. When I see, like, translate socials captions and pieces, I think there's a great way for the people. For example, on Pomelo, they all need their grants. Like, the grant applications for Pomelo often need are looking for translations to be done. I'm not sure if this scope is not big enough for your operations, but it's a great way to help out and get at least some payment for some of your workers. And then you have a point of contact with one of the projects that applying on Pomello. There are content producers that are looking for captions. Pretty sure. For example, we do do it the US hot Sauce, where we could talk about getting captions in there. Yeah. I think it would be a long conversation. I only have eight minutes left till my next meeting, but I just wanted to jump in because it popped up. I will focus then on getting these logos ready for the discord sticker format. And then I would need to contact the person that's the admin here. I think that's you, Rochelle. And then we can go through the process of adding these to your stickers here on the server.

David B

Right.

Martin Breuer

Would you need help with this or do you know how to do that?

Rochelle

Oh, I know how to add them in, yeah.

Martin Breuer

Okay. And just to clarify, are you interested in getting custom emojis, like small, like what we have currently on the US community discord? These animated, I love those.

Bree

Yeah.

Martin Breuer

So these are emojis. The stickers are a little bit more high resolution, and I think per server you have like 52 slots or 60 slots. I'm not sure for more high resolution stickers. They also attach to emojis, but it's different. Like emojis come as form of a pack, the sticker pack or basically an emoji pack that is specific to your server and the stickers is something different. So that's another thing we need to clarify. I think both is fine.

Rochelle

Design wise, our server can support 250 custom emojis and like 60 custom stickers.

Bree

This is going to be fun.

Martin Breuer

Yeah.

Bree

I'm going to get my sketchbook up, start drawing ideas up.

Martin Breuer

Perfect.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, go out. We need a lot like I think it'll definitely get a lot of I guess make more colorful the discord. I think all these stickers and emojis, it's kind of bland right now. Definitely make us more distinctive.

David B

Okay, this is exciting and ongoing conversation, but this has been a really great introduction. I'm very excited working together.

Martin Breuer

Yes.

Bree

I'll connect with you privately, Martin, and then just start sketching and I'll probably scan or photograph them because that's fine.

Martin Breuer

We can rebuild them potentially also do some small animations on these. So, yeah, let's get this conversation going. And if we have ideas for like, I think getting your news feed, for example, on the community discord and talking some other things, I think I will just continue the conversation with DJ strike over for now and then try to join this call in two weeks. Again, are there any other community calls that you guys are doing or is this like the regular one?

Bree

This is the regular one.

Martin Breuer

Okay.

Bree

There can be other ones pop up.

Martin Breuer

Okay, yeah, I will try to make it. When did it start? Like 16 UTC.

David B

17 UTC?

Bree

What's?

Martin Breuer

UTC universal time?

DJSTRIKANOVA

I know it's 5 hours, which is.

Bree

Yes, that should be six right there. An hour and an hour ahead of Amsterdam, whatever Amsterdam's time is that's? 05:00 there.

Martin Breuer

Okay, so it started like 26 hours, 26 minutes ago.

Bree

Yes.

Martin Breuer

Okay. That's my time zone, so same time zone, 17. Okay, I will make a note. Cool, awesome. Yeah, awesome. I will leave you guys then and see you in two weeks and continue discussion with Brie and Deejay. Striking over.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Sounds great. Thanks for stopping by.

Bree

Perfect.

David B

Bye bye.

Rochelle

Bye. Hey, Jesse.

Bree

He's just there in Ghost farm. No, he's actually there.

DJSTRIKANOVA

We can't hear you if you're saying something.

Bree

Yeah, the Green circle is going, but nothing's coming through. Always love hearing from you, Jesse. New speed into. That was really cool, martin stopping in like that. I'm excited. I get to do sketches.

Jesse

Hey guys, can you not hear me? It's so weird. I don't know what's happening. Discord disconnecting my mic or something because I see the green lights. Anyways, I just said, yeah, no, I was listening and I'm here. I didn't want to miss another Dow call because I missed the last two and it was bugging me. But I'm on my way to an appointment so I'm outside. It's quite noisy, so I'm listening and talking. So let me know if there's anything specific I can contribute to now. But yeah, also that Martin was here as well. It sounded exciting. And I'm also excited about the proposal DJ put up about putting more rewards available for the five box pool from Bank Exhaust. I totally think that's a great idea. I have to check with the vet and with Lawrence. We'll plan in a meeting just to see because we're a bit behind on the bank swap fees going to the Dow just to make sure we are aware of what's the amount of fee, if it's still pending to be added because the boat was disconnected. So that's one thing I wanted to add to that conversation. Yeah, I'm just listening because it's noisier.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, that's in reference to my proposal I just put up yesterday. Periodically the fees from the original liquidity pool contribution are added to the fee pool. But I thought it would be more useful if it would be put in the defy box as more liquidity. Because I think generally I think we need a good sizeable pool on defy box because it'll be great, just like for the EOS community to just have a respectable pool that's nice and big with not much what's it called when slippage not too much slippage. So, yeah, that's the main goal of my proposal.

Jesse

And about the $5. I had some concerns in the beginning, but I did some research over the weeks. I contacted some EOS developers. I talked with John from Boyd just to make sure that D Five books is very trusted and it's covered by the Recovery Plus protocol. So I'm really happy with the service, actually, and it's a good platform. So it's good to see the liquidity increasing there at the moment.

Bree

Nice to see it more visible, like on Point Gecko or Fancy.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. Last time I checked it was in December. I asked them and they said they're working on it. I can ask them again as well because yeah, I think that's something because I also noticed so EOS had their IBC, which connects the different, I guess, antelope chain, which is like which was EOS I O. It allows them to be like a cross chain with each other. And I saw UX, which I think is another chain. And so it seems like, to be honest, I think it's kind of been a problem for a while, but I think I'm going to push for them to keep working on, getting it on not just Coin Gecko, but also Coin Market Cap because it increases visibility of all EOS tokens. I think, like, in the current stage of their Yield Plus program, it's good for EOS, for sure. But I imagine they want other people to have tokens on EOS to be a thriving platform, not just for EOS. Right. So definitely something to keep needling them about.

David B

Yeah.

Jesse

The IBC part is also really interesting. I'm sorry, it's getting way too noisy. I think I believe this card. I'll be back later.

David B

I'll take a look at the Dow bank view. I think I know what's wrong with it.

Bree

Is that a manual transfer of the pancake fees into the Dow?

David B

We have about that calculate every week how much should go into the people and multi signatures generated and then pushed. And it hasn't been working properly. Just forgot about it for a while. Take a look at it.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. Generally the fees aren't that much because the volume for EFX hasn't been that high until recently. Like, in the last few months, we probably had more volume than the previous year or something. Right now it's like more significant. So it's probably worth looking into again.

David B

Yeah, it's more important. I think it might be worth it as well to integrate it into this work so that people can also see that, hey, look, there are some fees coming in instead of it being tucked away.

Bree

No, people like to see things like that. I have a question. I've got a friend coming to drag me out for breakfast, but my question is about the dashboard update for the Dow. How's that going?

David B

We haven't worked on that. I haven't had time to work on the dashboard recently. We haven't made the proper plan yet. It just goes away from us.

Bree

You should schedule a bit of time every weekend for it.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I have noticed that some newcomers are like so they see the task alerts, but they would like metrics, which is, I think something that's been on the I guess an ideation, a page where we can see like for example, in the last month, how many tasks were completed and how much Effix that was and how much fees were collected. I know. Is there a way in SDK? Is there a way to figure out the time frames of batches?

David B

Not at the moment.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Can you figure out the block of a task? Because I wonder, like, maybe we can I guess I'm just thinking out loud now. What if you can just associate with a cycle? Like which tasks were completed and which cycle? I guess something worth well, in any case, it's worth having some metrics, I think.

David B

Yeah, absolutely. I don't think we have something specific like that built at the moment. I don't think it would be too difficult to add. But yeah, I can totally see the value. Give some statistics that would encourage more people to start doing the project as they see how much value is flowing through the platform.

Bree

Yeah. And the life count of the transaction fees.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. I think on the Dow page, is it bugged for you guys to effect force overview? Does it not show any numbers anymore or, like, total transactions, total payouts? Does it work for you?

Rochelle

Oh, that's because that part was connected to the old platform, the centralized one.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. So it'll be nice if we could kind of just do an ad, what centralized was and then add on the new stuff so we have a complete picture of what we've done.

David B

Where is this? On which page is this?

Bree

The very first page on the dashboard.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, the front page.

Rochelle

You know, where it says, like, the amount of workers.

David B

Yeah. Okay, I see it now.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah.

Bree

I think that page could be a little more efficient, but I know you're working really hard on the next dashboard update.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. The only other thing to watch out for, I think, is so the numbers are good now, but I know I sent this in a DM to you earlier, David. I noticed on blocks, sometimes they don't correctly recognize the tokens, and so we end up having like, a negative number for our supply. So it's kind of odd it's not happening now, but it occasionally happens.

David B

Is the amount correct when it's a negative number?

DJSTRIKANOVA

No, I think I sent you a screenshot, but that's how it looks like. It just the numbers are completely off, and I think it's something because it happens on blocks. I'm not sure if it's like, specific to blocks or something, but.

David B

We'Re also retrieving it directly from the blockchain.

DJSTRIKANOVA

So maybe it's a problem with the node, you think?

David B

I honestly don't know. But if I look at it right now as well and I see that, for example, the total supply is being shown properly, I would think that indeed somewhere the value of return isn't correct and it's parsing it as a number.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. It's hard to figure out the source of this issue, I imagine, because it's fine now on blocks. So I wonder I don't know, it just happened for a couple of days, right? When there was a lot of volume. Literally, as I was explaining tokenomics to a person, this issue happened, and even on blocks, all their tokens, it wasn't just EFX, by the way. Literally every token you could go to blocks IO tokens. Right. And every single token had zero market cap because of this bug. And I'll just put in awkward positions, like, I don't want to explain this bug right now, but yeah, it went on for a couple of days, and I'm not sure why, but hopefully it's just something they fixed already and we don't have to worry about it, maybe, I don't know.

David B

I hope so. Yeah. That's on the way, especially if you want to showcase to somebody that some hard data. And then all of a sudden this seems like you're lying. I can imagine that. It's a good day, you're saying, I'll keep an eye on it. Shall we continue talking about the proposals?

DJSTRIKANOVA

I think we covered them all. Unless there's we could talk about because I know you want to build your hugging face depth, right? The grant for Mello.

David B

Yeah, that's right.

DJSTRIKANOVA

And I've been talking with a friend of mine. You may remember him, Femi. He would be interested in helping me out if I could get a grant for my NST search engine. So I think I may write a grant as well there.

David B

Okay? Yeah, of course I remember Fendi. That's nice. That's great. It's good to hear that he's still interested and wants to help Bill.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, martin was also talking about this earlier, so I also was talking with Abdo. Abdumata? I think Abdo is pretty busy lately, but yeah, I think I basically have a pretty good structure of how a translation depth would look like for Pamela. So that's another thing. I don't know how much I imagine that just we keep giving you work to do. Right. But I guess maybe I can get Femi to build it as well. I don't know. Because I know it will be very useful for them to have like just like this tool, like a really simple tool where they just select their grant and then they pay some EFX and then the workers all translated and then they can just put the translations on there because even on their GitHub they ask, do you do translation services?

Rochelle

There also has to be in that translation deck a way for the people to have a glossary they can upload where they want certain words to be of a certain context or not translated. That's something that unless you're super familiar with how the back end of translation works. For instance, I helped build a huge glossary for Craft Heinz because they had a lot of their jargon. I have a glossary that I've used for blockchain terms to be either translated or not translated over, like, ten different languages, I think. So in that got to be a place for the client to populate their own custom glossary.

Bree

It would be prudent, Rachel, for you to be involved, at least in the design of it.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, you have a lot of experience in the translations. It would be great to have another translation DAP on the decentralized platform.

Rochelle

Yeah.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Because I think we have a good pool of workers to pull from. I know in the EOS support call, they said they also did translation work, and there's also a good amount of international community members. So I think it could be just like I know EOS B's also does translation work. I think it will be a good app that will be a hit with the EOS community. That's for sure.

David B

Yes, it will definitely be interesting for Pamela that they can use it as well and will be in their good places if we manage to do this for them. But I also feel like we should focus a bit on building and creating apps that will create a lot of tasks for effect network. For me, that's really my main goal at the moment, to really make sure that the platform is always full of tasks. And maybe that means we should take a look at Pumano in order to help finance and show them that we're capable of building these kinds of things and that they'll also help us get more grounds for other projects in the future.

Rochelle

Yeah, because something to keep in mind too is that translation tasks, they're great, but they also exclude a lot of people if they're for niche like bilingual workers.

Bree

You can have that, you just need a good variety of tasks that anybody can do as well. Yes.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I think it's important normie to build it.

David B

Norman has also been built.

Bree

Because there's also like medical dictation tasks that can be done decentralized and there's all sorts of things but their niche I know.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Formello because there's always having another season, they will definitely bring a new acconse. It may not be a lot of tasks but there will be tasks every season I imagine. Yeah. The tricky part with the hugging faces, we'll need someone to subsidize the tasks to build a data set. Right. It may need to be us at first and then if maybe other parties are interested.

David B

That'S what I'm betting on. I'm betting on that we'll subsidize the tasks. I'm thinking about that for a while, for a couple of months. And then afterwards, after we demonstrated to the Hugging Face community that we have working use case that they will also integrate data sets.

Bree

And once you've got things established with one community, then you can move into a different community, start promoting it and you've got a working case to demonstrate with.

David B

Absolutely. But I think gun hugging face is a really big community that we can really establish hopefully a longterm relationship with before we move on to building with other communities.

Bree

Well, that's any of the DAPs though, right? Like translation services for EOS. If that's successful, there's so many other projects that also need it. Anyway guys, I think I need to go now. Yeah, good luck.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Have a good one.

David B

See you at the next one. Have a good day.

Bree

See you next time.

David B

We have lots to do the dashboard, work on the grants, building the DAPs and start organizing a new hackathon.

Rochelle

Yeah, I think launch us on 2.0.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I guess for the Dow updates it would be nice to have some simple metrics but yeah, I guess working DAPs are the most important followed by hackathon and followed by Dow updates. That's my opinion because I think over time I may be able to build out some metrics myself. So that may save the time because I just need to figure out I feel like in theoretically it should be possible to figure out the blocks the tasks correspond to and then if I can figure that out, then I can figure out using something. I imagine there has to be some way to convert blocks into real time like the block was done at this time.

David B

Yeah, I'm sure there is. You could probably get the transaction details of a certain when a certain task was done and then from that you can calculate backwards to what it should be.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yes. So I'll look into that. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

David B

Yeah, don't worry.

Yeah, I talked with Manfred and the other thing I have on my pipeline is I've been distracted this last week, but yeah, maybe I was thinking of adding also an alert for when cycles are ready to be voted on and when they end so people know that they can vote and also get the rewards. It will work in the same way as we have with the task alerts. I think we used to have a bot, but then it kind of stopped and I can look into it again.

David B

Do you mean the discord bot?

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I think there used to be a bot that told you when the proposal was up or something.

David B

Yeah, indeed. We had a discord bot that was written by Normie. It has been working for a while.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, normally linked the repo. So I think I'm able to take a look and see what I can copy over. And yeah, we can have another Dow alerts section maybe. I don't know.

David B

That would be nice. Especially now that more people are trickling in and we have a couple of new members, I think it would be useful to an extra tool to help engage them.

DJSTRIKANOVA

All right, is there anything else we wanted to cover?

Rochelle

Think of an influence. There's a bug. I got a report in GitHub, but other than that.

David B

No. It's really nice to see of the engagement that's been happening recently that people are interested again in effect network. You see that reflected in price and I'm looking forward to maintaining this hype.

Rochelle

Me too.

David B

But besides that, I can't think of anything else to add to the conversation. All right, anything else we want to discuss?

DJSTRIKANOVA

I think that covered it all and I guess I'll post this all later and I guess we'll talk. Or rather we'll have this Dow call again a couple of weeks.

David B

Yeah, two weeks. And by the way, I did see an email coming five minutes ago from Palmelo that grant applications are opening on the 22 February, so speak up to the devil.

Rochelle

Oh, now we can get criteria wants that opens up to see what all we have to provide.

David B

Yeah, exactly.
