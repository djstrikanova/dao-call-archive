## DAO Call Summary

* Discussed latest Farm Rewards proposal.
* Discussed cryptonode42/David's USDT proposal. It's a proof of concept that would allow the DAO to swap EFX for USDT. This could be used to build up a reserve of USDT for something that requires it in the future, such as a hackathon prize pool.

* David discusses progress on Worker front-end, it's a complete revamp that fixes many issues with the current implementation.
* Jesse discusses PythonSDK goal is for Machine Learning and AI space to be able to easily use Effect Network for their dataset annotation needs.
