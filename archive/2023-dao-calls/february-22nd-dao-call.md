## Generated Transcript

DJSTRIKANOVA

All right, so here's the DAO call for February 22, 2023. And I guess for Rochelle said I can talk about my proposal, the number one thirty, the special mining fund. So basically, I have talked with Raven, who is, I guess, the admin there in the Telegram for Defibox. I was just looking into how because occasionally you can see they do promotions where you have one token and their box token being rewards for providing liquidity to one of their pools. And so we can set it up to have EFX and box rewards for three months as a promotion. And it also can include, if we have materials explaining effect, network effect DAO, what it does, how it works, what's our goal. They can also send it to their user base to just spread awareness of what the project does. And so that's something I kind of been asking for in the discord. Hopefully you can help as well. Rochellee. I know Gabby has a lot of content she created over the months on Twitter, and I was wondering if we can have it all curated into, like I think she called it a pitch deck. And I think that's kind of what I think would help. That can kind of summarize effect network effect. Now, why is it useful and what does it do? What you can get out of it. And so that way I can just send it to a defy box people for them to kind of send. And also, if it's possible, it would be great if we could have this translated into Chinese as well, because I know for defy box, a substantial user base are Chinese speakers. So I think it could help with outreach.

Rochelle

That is a good idea.

DJSTRIKANOVA

And all these documents, I think we could just reuse with any other collaborations in the future as well. So once we just have a good base of documents, we can just keep sharing them.

Rochelle

Yeah, I like that. Did I miss what form of the promo stuff do they need from us? They want it as a PDF or slides, I think.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I assume they're going to be sharing it as pictures, like on Twitter or their Telegram. So I was thinking, like, basically a PDF made of images.

Rochelle

Okay. Yeah. So it needs to be visual and have the info.

Bree

Would slide deck not be easier to separate the images out of?

Rochelle

Yeah, if we just make it with a pitch deck, like in Google Slides, you can save each slide as a PNG, then afterwards so give them all those. Yeah, because we could also just share them. Here's our Google Slide deck. Or here it is, an image form. I like your ideal, too, because that is perfect. We can totally do that on the platform, too, in house.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, that'll be great. Because I think there's at least with the five box, we've always had the effect always had, like, a relationship because we have the EFX NFX pool. So I think it's good to kind of outreach to the user base there so they know what we do and why we're there.

Rochelle

Yeah.

DJSTRIKANOVA

And I know Richard was also asking for something like this as well. On his hand. I forgot the name of them, but they did an interview with from AGI, the Singularity Net, the CEO, they did an interview with him at this investment.

Rochelle

Firm and I think Richard Ben guy ben, was it? Ben. Ben?

DJSTRIKANOVA

Ben. Richard was looking for a good way to summarize what the Fact Network does. So I think a slide for that is like I think basically these slides, I think we could use it for a lot of things once we have a good base for it.

Rochelle

We partnered with them a very long time ago and I used to talk with someone from their team hold on, it was on my chat with him. Oh my God, telegraph is insane.

Bree

So you're saying you already have a contact with them?

Rochelle

Yeah, and I talked with him quite a bit. I'll find the name here in a second, but yeah, I'm really liking this with the D five box. So we have to allocate 230,000 EFX.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I see it. 30,000 of that will be used for an AirDrop and then the other 200,000 will be distributed as rewards over three months. And the way I also requested David, I think he just said that it shouldn't be too hard because I think this could be a good case for ATP because they have a specific EOS account for this. And if we can have the DAO send it there, I think it will be a good feature to have for the DAO to be able to send EFX to a target EOS account.

David B

Yeah, I also really like this idea. I think we should do it.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Now. We could pay off that loan because I know we still owe the foundation, like how much we agreed upon, but the proposals for requesting the funds haven't been asked. So we can just do it outright ourselves. If we can just point EFX to a Target destination.

David B

Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, we should do that the next cycle for sure.

Bree

Yeah.

David B

But yeah, I think this is a really great idea of trying to engage another community and getting more people aware of the fact. Yeah, I'm totally for it.

Bree

Well, another community is a perfect place to get started on that type of outreach.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. If you want as well to add a length, you said you can do this in house perhaps. So I don't know if you want to add Turkish as well because I know EOS seems to have a pretty high population of Turkish speakers as well.

Rochelle

Yes, it is, but damn, getting the translation for Turkish, it's really hard.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. If it's too much, just like if it's possible, because if we could have this base pitch deck set of slides because there's a lot of outdated information and it can be a struggle to explain everything. And just having a complete set of, like, how effective network as it is right now works and how you can benefit I think would help.

Rochelle

My contact with Singularity net, it was Tim Richmond, but I don't think he's with Singularity anymore.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Maybe we can still talk to him and have him connect to to who replaced them if he found another.

Rochelle

Yeah, I don't even know if he's this company too. I'll figure it out. And there's another one because I'm looking on the thing. This was the Telegram chat started back in July of 2021. And it was this person with singularity ivy banali. She works there. Oh, she still works there. Okay. I can get back a hold of her and yeah, but I'm going to do it in a different chat because this one's not good.

Bree

Okay.

Rochelle

The owner of this chat isn't around anymore, so I won't chat in this thread, but I'll contact this lady too. But we would be spending the entire $230,000, right?

DJSTRIKANOVA

Well, technically not really, because it would be distributed to all the liquidity pool providers and like 40% of that is the foundation. So I don't know, maybe it could be recycled. But yes, basically, yeah. Like all 230,000 would be sent to do five box to distribute.

Rochelle

I like this idea.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I was talking with Raven. She also suggested we could potentially do during the promotion, I think something called, like I just termed it like a mutual AMA where some representative from Defy Box can answer any questions about Defy Box in our community and then someone who wants to represent the DAO can answer any questions in their community.

Rochelle

Okay. Kind of like a Twitter space conversation or something like that.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Well, maybe I decided that we should wait until like I want to see how the rest of the DAO votes on this idea. Yeah, but yeah, I was thinking if everything's going smoothly, we can set something up like that in the middle of the promotion. So probably be a couple of months from now.

Rochelle

Yeah, but yeah, I'm definitely going to vote yes for this. So as it passes, I will definitely be all in helping with the materials and that stuff. So I think it's good for us, it's good for the network.

David B

So we try to do this within the next couple of weeks and try to get as much attention as possible for effect. Considering the Palmer low season just opened.

Rochelle

Yeah.

David B

I don't know how feasible it will be to actually get all of the promotional material, but I think doing the payment should be relatively easy. But yeah, so I'm not sure, but I would like to try to catch that deadline.

Bree

So the promotional material, you're just thinking of taking the tweets that have been posted and compiling them, that was in.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Reference to the images we already made. That's already made. Right. Because there's a good amount of images. But I don't mind if new content is made, too.

Rochelle

Yeah. If I blocked out a good uninterrupted 3 hours, I could get this done.

DJSTRIKANOVA

That would be great if you can.

Rochelle

Yeah, because I can hit up Gabby if I need some visual stuff change since she's the one that made the original ones. I think we've got a stigma. I can get in her Pigma and pull around and make this stuff. I mean, I'm up for making it, especially if we get all the exposure on D five box. It's like what David said. The Pamela thing is going, and if they see us, if they already recognize us from, like, D five box as the Pamela season is going and they're looking at okay. They're around a lot. They're not, like, new and unknown. I think it just helped for more recognition.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. That's my general goal with the EOS outreach. And that's also why I've been talking with Gems, which is related to your proposal, Brie, for a competition. I don't know how you want to be, like, in house competition or you.

Bree

Want, like I have no idea. I just want to see if they want to take it to a competition, and then a few of us can hash out details. And I'm hoping Alan might be one of those who might help hash out details, because really, it's his thought to turn into a competition. I just want to see some more engaging, fun community stuff. That's all. My goal is with it.

Rochelle

If we turn it into, like, an event and then advertise it in the Eels community, too, and be like, hey, we're having a competition with this, and invite people into our server and into our events to participate, I think that's also a way to bring in outsiders, too.

Bree

It's possible, but I think one of the other things to ask is, if we're turning into competition, there needs to be some kind of prize.

Rochelle

Yeah.

Bree

And what level of prize do we wish to issue out? And if we go out of our own community, then I think the price needs to be a little more substantial.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. You should also talk with Martin, because maybe he knows, because I imagine he's connected with a bunch of artistically capable people. You can inquire how much they.

Bree

Yeah. At this point, because this is not something where there's this big rush to get done. Right. It's just something I wanted to see some colorful emojis that reflect our brand right. Or stickers that reflect us, and maybe that might lead to a character that could be used in certain cases, promotional or memes or things like that. Right. We've talked about that before, and the biggest setback before was trying to balance a business appeal to a meme type community appeal, and we couldn't find that middle ground. So maybe through emojis and these stickers, there could be either a middle ground found or a defined realization that we have two streams of appeals. We want to go to a more business one, which is like this promotion deck you're after, or a more engaged, the fun side of the community. And rarely the two would meet except in spaces like disc corridor. Yeah, I don't know. I know it's not straight simple, but I wanted something fun and for me it was just, you want it, do it, get it done. But Alan suggested the competition, and he's right. So if not a competition, at least open it up to others. So it's not just me. I am not the best designer out there. I've got a few little things that I can do quite happily, and then beyond that, it's like somebody else should do it. But there are definitely people with the skills that could come up with something brilliant. So a competition creates more open space for that to happen. We can talk to Martin more, but right now, I just want to see what the community feels.

Rochelle

I said something like a bag of EFX as a price and then also make it enough to where we can point out that it's also enough with a little bit extra, that if you wanted to join our DAO, you could, because what it's taking? 500 EFX. So a minimum, the price would be 500 EFX and then a role in discord that lets them make more, that gets recognized that they were the designer. Something like that. So a bag of EFX, the ability to join the DAO for free and then a shiny new role.

Bree

Well, if we were going to encourage it for DAO, I'd like to see them get enough Effs to purchase an equal amount of NFX. Or we provide entrance into the doubt with the 500 EFX and 500 equivalency. So they're not just there, but they're there with a voice.

Rochelle

Or do a prize of whatever EFF and a DAO entry of 500 EFX plus one NFX, you know what I mean? So they could get in and vote even though there wouldn't be that much weight. And then they also have a price pull of that and then a shiny role in recognition on this court.

Bree

Yeah, something like that. Yeah. I haven't really thought that part through. Just merely should we do a competition or should we just get it done quickly with whatever I come up with? At this point, that's all I want to know.

DJSTRIKANOVA

We can do both. We have plenty of spots available, right?

Bree

Yeah.

David B

I like the idea. If you want to do some more community engagement, I think you should totally go for it and I think it'll be fun and the people that enjoy that kind of thing will also enjoy it. Absolutely.

Bree

I'm one of those that like the idea of having a little character that we could play around with.

Rochelle

Yeah, that's number. Reason number 88 brie wants a mascot. You've been wanting a mascot for years. This is how Brie gets her mascot.

Bree

Yes. This is my way of getting our mascot. And I realized mascots don't have to be on the business pitch decks. These are mascots that, as community members, we can start throwing around Twitter, we can start just making memes with. And if we make a character that's good for an emoji, it doesn't take much to shift that a little bit into being a mascot.

David B

Absolutely. I don't think you should wait for any kind of permission, and I think you should just go for it and throw it out there and let it grow organically.

Bree

Well, right now I'm just going to leave the proposal as is for sentiment. Do you want it or not? And if we want it until we're approving funds for a prize, we don't really need another proposal until that point. The rest of it can be hashed out in discord and in the Gems channel that we've already got going on this topic. And once we sort of get fixed on a prize, then I think that should be run through a proposal for approving the prize. But you're right, Rochellee, I totally want a mascot. And those mascots can be turned into NFTs. There's a whole bunch of fun stuff we can do with the mascot, and the mascot doesn't need to have anything to do with the professional pitch deck.

Rochelle

Sounds good. Okay, so to keep moving along and to keep on track with here, we have a really special proposal that David posted. Number 129 pamelo grant for effect. DAO So, Dave, take it away.

David B

So, indeed, as DJ, alluded to or inspired me to do was to also apply for a Palmer Grant and to create a better integration with Hugging Face. And I think there's a lot of potential there, but I want to do it via the DAO. We want to create a path where we can apply for grant applications for the ENF eventually. And one of the to be eligible for the ENF grant for the higher tiers was to have a successful Palmer Low grant submission. And one of the limitations of the ENF grant is that you haven't done the token sale in the past. So I was hoping that the DAO can be then the recipient and the custodian of the grant from Palmelo. And with that, we can then also apply for other grants. For now, I'm going to apply for a grant on Palm below for about $10,000 to develop a DAP with Hugging Face, where we'll be augmenting data sets for Hugging Face and creating a generic interface for other community members of Hugging Face to be able to do that for themselves as well. And hopefully we'll be able to generate a lot of tasks as well then for workers, and we'll be able to create a very successful use case. But yeah, the idea is that the DAO will then be the one that will be receiving the grant and then paying out to those who help create and develop gaps for it.

Bree

I think that's really good. I like your things to keep in mind. Number one, even if you don't get the grant, or even if we don't get the grant, it's establishing the DAO as an entity. It's responsible like that.

David B

Yeah, that's the idea that the DAO can manage funds and is able to create budgets to help then be the custodian of effect network and making sure that development keeps happening and things are being maintained and new features are being developed. Right now we only have a fund of EFX, but if we start using EFX and selling that EFX, and that will also have an exit price impact on the price. So hopefully we'll be able to have successful grant applications with other kinds of funding.

Rochelle

Yeah. So this would basically the funds are granted in EOS, right?

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah.

Rochelle

So we would be holding on to some EOS and then as the DAO, we could buy EFX with it and distribute to the developers who are building this.

Bree

Right.

DJSTRIKANOVA

No, I think it would be better if we just keep the EOS because we can just use EFX from the treasury. I'm not sure how they would think about that. I think it's best if we reserve any EOS through those donations, in my opinion, to be paid as labor costs.

Rochelle

Yeah, that's true.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Because I think what David wants to do with effect DAO is kind of like unprecedented for Pamela. I don't think it ever happened. It has always been individuals or like teams, but never just like a DAO. I think it will definitely spark interest, but I don't know how it works.

Rochelle

I think it would be accepted well, because if you look, they're all very familiar over at Pamela with like, Eden.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah.

Rochelle

And since our dashboard, the thing is.

DJSTRIKANOVA

With Eden first, there's like an explicit rule of Pamela, you can't donate to your own grant. Right.

Rochelle

Yeah.

DJSTRIKANOVA

And so they actually crack DAOn on Eden because you have delegates who can be elected pledging that they're going to use those funds to vote for their own project. Right. And it's Eden's funds. But because they're the custodian, the consensus is that they're not allowed to donate. And also team members also are not allowed to donate. So by extrapolation, I think we should probably ask to get this clarified. But if it's the DAO applying is the DAO itself and it's entirely prohibited from donating. It's a question that hasn't been asked yet, but I think it will be. But I think it's worth trying anyway.

Rochelle

That is a good question because maybe we could have it like, listen, can just our High Guard members of the DAO be excluded from donating? You know?

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. We'll have to make sense that any.

David B

Member of the DAO wouldn't be able to donate?

DJSTRIKANOVA

Well, it will be hard to enforce. I guess they could ban the most active members and I can probably not donate either, but I don't know if we can stop any member.

Rochelle

Yeah, I agree.

Bree

I don't think you can stop any member. If it's going to be the Full South, then this might not work. But if it's just a High Guard that actually makes sense because the High Guard is the one with the approval authority.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I think you should talk with the guys at Pamela to see what they think. Yeah, that is a good idea because it's just unprecedented in my opinion because we actually as a DAO can literally have as a DAO once it's transferred to the DAO Treasury we can have ATPs to send to people now, right? I assume we do implement it so we can send the EOS in the treasury, right?

Bree

Yes.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I think in general, the capabilities of the DAO that affect DAO has is much more than any other DAO and it's because of that that we have the High Guard right, because we don't even know what type of ATPs people can bring up but it also gives us more capabilities. But anyway yeah, my main point is do engage with the Pamelo people to see what the rules will be because we want to follow the rules, whatever they are and because it's an impressive it's a situation that I think hasn't really happened before. It's good to have their input before we just jump in doing it.

Rochelle

Yeah, that's true. Make sure it's good from the get go, but yeah, that's a good point.

David B

I agree, that's a good point. I haven't thought about that. I just kind of assumed that any entity such as that would be able to participate and I didn't think about.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Well, they could participate as part of.

David B

The rules but I'll look at the terms and conditions to make sure and talk to them.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I mean, even if the DAO participates, if you want to meet your funding goal it requires the rest of the community, in my opinion. Yeah, but we want to make sure we don't get like disqualified for something because they have their rules and it's best to make sure we always are following them.

Rochelle

Yeah, when we approach them and ask for clarification we should also have at the ready an explanation with the High Garden, the ATP and where this would go by the treasury and only who would be able to distribute those funds and show that it's just a small group of people and not the greater DAO. So can we do it with the greater DAO being able to contribute but just not these people who would be in charge of the funds? I think that's the best way to approach them.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Clarify for now, we should ask if it works as a DAO completely because I don't know, maybe it doesn't, maybe it extends too far I have no idea what they will think. And also, we got to make sure. I'm also going to be applying for a grant for my NFT Content Index and search, but I also will be supporting all the grants in my collection because there are good ones there that I think we're supporting. And I want to make sure we, as a DAO, encourage everyone to participate completely in Familial, because there's a lot of projects that there are many cases where things that benefit EOS benefit Effect Network and vice versa as well. And that's, I think, what we want to establish.

David B

Great. I do think that for the short term, it would make more sense for me to apply as an individual, but I think for the long term, it makes more sense to try to apply as a DAO, and hopefully we can set the President for the future as well.

Bree

If our DAO is so different from, like, if the High Garden and the ATPs make our DAO really different from Even Eden, then they need to understand that it's not the typical DAO that they're familiar with. And how does our DAO fit into their rules? Long term? Yeah, it would be better, but from.

David B

What I've understood, is that Even was kind of messing around with the rules of how to get more funding.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Well, I don't think they're necessarily messing around. It's more like people kind of it's just inherent to how Eden works. Right. Because you have these four people that have within their small little group campaign why they should go up a higher level. Right. And some of them say they're running a very good project, and they believe it should have support, and they convince the rest to vote for them, and they want to use the Eden funds they get to support that project. Excuse me. Sorry. So they want to use those funds, but these things are debates in the Pamela community, and I think basically it ended up being that not that there weren't dissent. It's just that even people cannot donate to their own grants, and then it added up. So team members also cannot donate. So I'm just like viewing the trend here. Right. Basically the general trend, it seems, is, like, people who are associated with this project on Pamelo shouldn't be able to use the quadratic funding system, and I think that's reasonable, but it's just like, what would apply to a whole DAO if it's the DAO being represented? I don't know. That's something it's just we'd have to ask the Pamela community. I could post it right now or maybe just in the week after we get some votes, because it's probably better to make sure, like, everyone's voting yes, but yeah, I think as long as we engage, it's fine. You just got to make sure we don't surprise them.

David B

Okay. Yeah, I agree. I think maybe that might also be a good to keep in mind that potentially people from Ardao won't be able to participate. And depending on how that goes, we can weigh off what's the better strategy, but indeed, I'll join this court as well and talk to them and figure out what's better and how they think about what we're trying to do.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, and join their telegram as well. I think there's more activity in their telegram, but yeah, you can post it because their Discord is just on the EOS Discord. It's like they have a special channel.

David B

But we can also potentially give them a list of our Discord members or our DAO members and inform them that, hey, we want to do this as a DAO, but we're aware of their rules, and here is a list of all of the members of her dao. And we want to make sure that we do this by the book. And you can make sure that any people that do contribute to the Palmer Grants that are on this list wouldn't be able to.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Well, first, just have clarification of how they see a DAO participating as collectively. And I think if they think that it should be restricted, we can maybe get a compromise where only the top it's not like we have that many DAO members participating. To be honest. In the last total, it was like 20 something. So I don't know, whatever happens, we can make sure that we make the rules explicit. After you. So everyone on the DAO is aware of it. It's just the only thing is we got to figure out, like, how it applies. But I think it's a good for the general goal of having the DAO as a representative, because I think it's a good idea to have the DAO because the DAO was created independently of the Effect Networks Foundation. Even the original White paper only references governance in a very abstract like, just that it would exist. Right. The DAO itself was created by EFX members Staking or by Effect Network members Staking for NFX. So I think even if it's a small amount of people, the creation of Effect Thou, in my opinion, was decentralized, and we used to have a lot more members, and it's just the bare cycle kind of discouraged people to leave. But I think the origins of Effect DAO is decentralized and independent.

Rochelle

Example tech Network and doing this sorry, this is for the DAO to create a DAP that provides things for the greater good. And this DAP, it would help so many of these people with their data sets. On Hugging Face, for one, it uses the blockchain, it uses the network, and then this DAP would also make tasks for workers on the network. And the DAO would own this DAP. It would be their DAP.

DJSTRIKANOVA

The DAP would be open source, right?

Rochelle

Yeah, it'd be open source, but it would be the depth.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. My answer for this proposal is going to be yes. And I think as. Long as we talk about it and are open about it with the EOS community, I don't think there will be any negative views. We just want to make sure we engage with the community and make sure how the rules are written on Pamela. We're not skirting anything and I don't think we will be, but the only issue is just more like how much of the doubt is considered the team if it's the doubt. So I think I said like three times now, but yeah, that's the only thing I could be a little bit worried about. But the rest I think is solid because along with the grant, I want to publish the NST search index. I feel like these types of DAPs are sort of lacking on Thomaslo, like data set oriented, like machine learning AI, like related applications. I don't think there's or so far I haven't really seen any. So I think we can fill a niche that can help EOS be more competitive because I think the future is going to be like, which blockchains can help AI the most? And I think building these data sets, having it's kind of like something with Pulsar. I don't know if you remember, I linked Pulser a while ago and they have their own NFT search engine, but I think it's still closed beta. And I think just having like with my grant, I think just having a tool that can build an index and lets you search NFTs basically of any type, using any model from Hugging Face, that's like, I think a better way to have content be accessible. I think the general field we're going for is to satisfy a niche that hasn't been satisfied in EOS and I think that's totally possible right now.

David B

Absolutely. I do think you've made an excellent point and that machine learning is here today. It's a growing industry, there's a lot of money being poured into it. And on the other hand, you do have EOS, which is a pretty great ecosystem. There is a really solid technology here, but it's missing a killer app that will attract users and I think this might be a good bridge in between then EOS having a blockchain and being able to augment data for machine learning models, I think this could be very fruitful. But I also hope that with this we'll be able to access ENF grants as well because with the ENF, they are very explicit about their rules that are very strict about who can apply for a grant and who can't. And hopefully this will help us get a bit closer or be eligible for an ENF grant in the future.

Rochelle

Yeah, and one of the requirements is to have received a grant on Pamela as well. So, yeah, we'll address these points with the Pamelo people and get going on that. But in the meantime, I still want people to vote with their heart on this proposal. Yes or no? Even though some of these things we have to clear up just to make sure we're eligible. We really need the DAO to decide we're doing this or not.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I think even if the DAO is prohibited from donating, we should still do it as the DAO because I think long term that will help us the most.

Rochelle

Exactly.

DJSTRIKANOVA

And even if we're not able to participate with this grant, I'll still support other grants because I think, as I said before, I think as a DAO we are focused on something that's niche but also, as David said, getting bigger and bigger and I think we can serve a good purpose for EOS. So I think we can make a good case for it. Absolutely.

David B

I'm also excited to see your Nifty index search engine. I'm very curious to see what it's going to look like and how it's going to function.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I think I wanted to be kind of very straightforward, something that I've just been mulling on for like four months now. But yeah, originally, do you remember I already built a good chunk of it for numbers protocol but I didn't know how to do the image recognition part. But now Hugging Face has made it so easy. You just pull a model and write a Python script and there you go. My main goal is not only can you use this NFT search requires an index and so if you can build an index, you can have search with the index. If you can just pull off the right model whether like for example, if you have NFTs of songs, right? If you can use the model to figure out what the genre of the song is or what type of vibes it has and then generate index for that, you can use this same tool to generate index for music. And I'm sure there's probably going to like I haven't done a deep dive but I'm sure there's models for video content as well. And so I think basically with Hugging Face models you can create a searchable index of any content and all my opinion of NFTs is they're fungible tokens, but if they have content it's usually a pointer to a link to some content elsewhere. Right? And so it's not indexed in any search. And that's my main point in the grant. Like if you go to Atomic Hub where you can buy EOS NFTs, the content of the image is nowhere in related to the search results. If you search for a hat you have to have it explicitly in the name of NFT or the collection. It's not going to look at the image and say and return results where there's a hat. Right. So I think if you can just do recognition to find all the hats and people can find NFTs with hats, I mean, that's just an example but it can be done with anything. And so all those 2 million then finally some can be more discovered. Otherwise it's all just pure name recognition at this point. Right. With NFT collections, the most successful ones are the ones that just have name recognition. But whether people just want art that appeals to them, that has a specific thing they're looking for, for them to be able to find it, I think is key.

David B

Yeah. Potentially a service will also be interested in using such a service.

Bree

I'm always looking for art. It's really hard to find something specific unless you know the artist's name. Anyway, I have to switch off in ten minutes or less. Six minutes. I don't think I have anything else particularly I need to talk about right now.

Rochelle

No, I think we covered the agenda and the current proposals and this stuff. I wrote DAOn the materials for the DFI box stuff here. I'm going to put it in my schedule to block out the thing of time this week. Probably I can pop it in Friday. So pop it in Friday, get that done and then share it and see what you guys think. That's not too late a time, is it?

David B

That would be awesome.

DJSTRIKANOVA

That's plenty of time. I think I gave them the estimate of one month from now so we have time for voting on the sentiment and then voting on the ATP.

Bree

Okay.

DJSTRIKANOVA

I guess David's proposal is still going to take two weeks for the cycle, so I wouldn't post the grant until those two weeks are up. Right, okay, so I think we have some time.

David B

Yeah, good point, but isn't it better to post it sooner rather than later?

DJSTRIKANOVA

Well, I guess you can post it, but just post the one that's sure that it's going to pass no matter what.

Rochelle

Yeah. I'll still work on it though Friday. That way I'm pretty sure this is going to pass the pitch deck that.

Bree

You'D be working on that would work.

Rochelle

For anything, so it's not like getting away. Yeah.

Bree

So taking it to a university who is focusing on machine learning or something.

Rochelle

Yeah. So I got this scheduled in for Friday, so I'll do that and then I'll share it and you guys can review and help me get some feedback and stuff in case I miss certain points or whatever. So I'll put that on here.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, we can refine it.

Rochelle

Yeah, got it. Okay.

Bree

Cool. So I'm just going to keep plugging away at my little drawing for the next few weeks. Competition or no, they're kind of fun when I'm in the mood to do them. Cool.

David B

Yeah, I'm excited to see the mascot.

Bree

I think we're a long way off the mascot yet. Emoticons and then stickers. And then mascot or mascot then stickers. I'm not sure.

Rochelle

What a great meeting, guys.

David B

Yeah, I'm excited.

Rochelle

It'S on time. We're almost at the hour, so cool.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, we covered everything.

Bree

Awesome job.

DJSTRIKANOVA

Then we'll keep up to date with everything and I guess until next time, we'll have another DAOn call.

Rochelle

Okay, sounds good.

Bree

Have a good two weeks. We'll read you in between. Read your comments in between.

Rochelle

Engage in between.

Bree

Okay, I'm off. Bye.
