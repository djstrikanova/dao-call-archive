# April 5th DAO Call

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R383FKfU7_Q&t=2s" %}

## DJSTRIKANOVA's General Summary

* "In regards to user interface, I think. David's on vacation right now. Laurens has been working on a lot of the interface, user interface updates. There's going to be a complete redesign." - Rochelle
* Rochelle has gotten the Chinese translations for Defibox, just formatting of text remaining.
* Rochelle back to be more active, discuss potential events and partnerships with other EOS discord groups.
* The ATP for the Defibox 230,000 EFX transfer had an oversight. Jesse programmed the expiration date to be too soon, so it cannot be executed. Jesse has proposed an HG resolution ATP with a proper expiration date. This resolution wouldn't needed to be voted on by the DAO during a cycle, and can just be executed with enough approvals on the multisig.
* What do DAO members think of selling DAO treasury EFX in a lump sum in exchange for funding such as sponsoring hackathons for several years. One example could be pitching to the ENF a lump sum of EFX in exchange for financial support for hackathons on DoraHacks to build dapps on EOS EVM, such as say X EFX in exchange for Y dollars to fund a prize pool for hackathons for Z times a year.
* GPT-4 Helping progress of NFT Indexer application. DJSTRIKANOVA figured out how to classify images running HuggingFace AI models locally, all that's remaining is writing out the complete application.

#### Rochelle

There. I put the invitation up.

#### Bree

Hey, Rochelle, I think the show is yours. Update. Yay.

#### Rochelle

Okay, so today is April 5, 2023, and it is the Dow call. One moment here. I try to get through this without coughing too much. So I have some updates. I got the marketing PDF that Gabby had shared. I submitted it to EOS B's, and I got the translation back in Chinese, but I have it in a Word document. I have to put it into our PDF with the font that's readable for simplified Chinese. So I'm doing that, and then I will publish that. The cost wasn't too bad. I went ahead and just paid it out of my EOS account, and it was let me look here. There we go. I sent them what was it? 26 EOS. So that wasn't too bad. I'm going to share it with everybody, and then I think I'm going to put in a proposal to the Dow back for the 26 EOS. Yeah, that's fine, but I'll include it with the proposal and then to the original PDF of the marketing materials. There were a few things I'd corrected, so I have an updated version, but I think with my proposal, I'm going to post it tomorrow.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Are you part of the group chat I set up? Did I add you?

#### Rochelle

I don't know. Which one did you add on?

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

On Telegram. I set up a group chat with Gabby, Jesse, Me and Raven from Defy Box. So I can add you on Telegram because that's where materials have been posted.

#### Rochelle

You know what? I have my stuff set to where people can't automatically add me because I was getting added into all kinds of crazy things. Message me the link and then like, an invite to join, and then I'll join it.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

All right, I'll do that.

#### Rochelle

It's probably white. I'll share it in there too. But I'll put both versions in the proposal, asking the dial back for the 26 years. And yeah, that was my update. Gabby and I've been meeting with a lot of marketing idea stuff. We're expanding on the Twitter spaces we're doing I'm in the middle of creating blog posts and content from our previous spaces, and I'll be doing that with today's space as well. We're going to have some cool things, I think, with some of our Discord and Telegram groups. With this Twitter spaces thing. I just saw a pop up message from Richard. Where'd it go? Maybe not. So I have been hitting the books, making a lot of content for it. I'm going to completely enhance our marketing part of our Discord server. And then what is it? We have some plans to really put a lot more attention to our Discord with the networking and stuff on it. Discord has been kind of quiet. It needs to be ramped up. So we're going to be having a lot more events and activities and things on our Discord networking with other projects and EOS their Discords, getting their people coming to ours. It's going to be a lot of work. I'm going to be back to living on Discord full time again.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

That sounds good. The only thing I could add what? Were you saying something, Brie?

#### Bree

I was saying it sounds like fun.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Okay. I noticed that one thing we could improve on, I think is Wolf Effect Force, for example. It's like basically a finance smart chain, DAP. Right. So there are sites like, I made a thread that maybe we can submit to have it listed, which I think could help a little bit.

#### Rochelle

Oh, yeah, like that?

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

So I got a thread, I think.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

It'S in general of a place where we could post where a listing could help. I know I told Jesse it's probably still a work in progress, but I know DAP radar, we definitely need a presence. Like the activity on the Force should be represented on DAP radar. That's another thing that can be improved on, I guess. Yeah. Because it's already a work in depth. Right. So really just need to make sure it's on the listings on where it can be listed.

#### Rochelle

Yes. And I was able to get control of the account back to us for our listing on DAP radar. And you'll notice, like, the logo got updated, some of the things got updated. There still needs to be more work with screenshots of DAP. I need to make longer descriptions for it. So that is a work in progress. Right now, we still can't figure out who on the team had made that account. And I'm thinking it was like pre ICO time when that was done, but we have control over it now and can update it. So I'm very happy about that. Another thing is we haven't been going to a lot of events lately in the past, like year or more, and there's so many events and happenings with the EOS community. So Gabby's putting together a list and getting all of the events for I'm sorry, I'm going to cough again. Today is a trying day and I have a lot of tea, but it's not working for us to attend, whether in person or virtual, all kinds of stuff, getting a list together and then we're looking at what's doable and things like that. It's really time to blast all this up. So that's my biggest update is marketing materials are started. We have the effect dow we have a Google Drive. I know, Brie, you've been in there. I'm going to start adding all this stuff, all kinds of marketing stuff, graphics, logos, content presentations and things in that drive and putting it links of it in our Discord server. So any of us Dow members can utilize these things anytime we need. And it'll be just an easy way to have a library of when we need stuff and where to host it that everyone can get to it.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, that's great. That's what I envisioned. I'm hoping that all this material you're creating for Defy Box, we can just reuse in the future.

#### Rochelle

Exactly. I want to make all kinds of versions of all different things and just have a whole drive dedicated to all this stuff. And then in there too, I want to have a document that says, like, point of contact, who to contact for partnerships or more information about the Dow and stuff like that. Because this will be a public accessible Google Drive, so we might as well have a document that, I mean, the public can't edit. But it has all kinds of info, too, because I know we have it on our website and our socials and all these platforms, but still, who knows? Someone could be doing a meet up or whatever, and they could have that just to print out and be like, here, pass it out, stuff like that. So a lot of things going on. Gabby and I have been doing so much planning, and now it's time to post it all out for you guys. And I'm going to be back to full time living on Discord. I had some health stuff that I needed to take care of. Okay. It is Wednesday. It's the first Wednesday of the month. I heard tornado sirens, and I've been traumatized the last week. Yeah, we were traveling over the weekend, helping out family and stuff, and it was just catastrophic. But okay, I'm good now that I realized the first Wednesday of every month here where I live, they do the sirens as a drill. So I can ignore this one. But where was I saying? I'm so sorry. That just rattled me.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

You were talking about well, I guess your health, I guess. Improving.

#### Rochelle

Yeah, improving. And I have a software issue with my phone. I got to get Discord back on. I'm going to be back into living on Discord. We're going to have events. I'm going to have the bot do a bunch of postings. There's going to be so much interaction back to how it used to be hopping in our server. We've tried the forum stuff. I was really thinking in the beginning it was going to work well. Now I'm not so sure. I think it's as soon as I.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Got used to it, you're like, we don't need it anymore.

#### Rochelle

No, like some things.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

But yeah, it does kind of feel.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Like a ghost town.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

I feel like sometimes I'm the only.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

One posting stuff.

#### Rochelle

And it's like we're only using the chat ones more than we are the forum thread ones. So I think the forum thread ones are going to kind of be like directory like folders, and we're just going to go back to chatting more, but then keeping the stuff that we don't want lost in the chat in the forum things.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, that's exactly how I treat it. Usually I like specific things. I want to archive for myself. I put in a thread rather than the chat because it's much easier to find it that way.

#### Rochelle

Yeah, we gave the forum stuff as like the main way of communicating a good try, but it just didn't work.

#### Bree

It's not conducive to conversation.

#### Rochelle

It's not. And it's really taken and I hate saying it, but I'll admit it when I try something and it didn't work out and I was wrong in my hypothesis. Yeah.

#### Bree

But I do like the forums for retaining a specific topic.

#### Rochelle

Yeah, it's good for some things, but I think just the conversation and the interaction and stuff, we're so small still. I don't know.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, it's hard to really give a good I feel like you can't really evaluate until we get bigger which one's really better or not.

#### Rochelle

Oh, yeah. Hey, Richard.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

If you're talking Richard, we can't hear you.

#### Rochelle

I could hear you.

#### Bree

Yeah.

#### Rochelle

Right. Click on him on his icon and where it says user volume, put it all the way up. That's what I just did. I don't know if it's something I can do because I'm an admin, but.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

It'S already at 100% for me.

#### Rochelle

Okay, then I did it.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

So if I'm not, maybe I just need to disconnect and reconnect. 1 second.

#### Rochelle

If you're in the car and I'm a pro at doing voice when I'm in the car in meetings, lean way forward and yell, even though you might look ridiculous to other drivers. I do it all the time.

#### Richard

Yeah, brilliant. It's great to be here. Obviously, I've just said sorry, I haven't been able to get any calls. I've just flat out and stuff and I've tried to juggle things, but my heart's in the project and I have been working in the background trying to collaborate, get collaborations and talk and put the word about Effect Force. Really? I'm going to Nepal. The flights are booked in on the 26 April. So what I want to try and do, I wanted obviously get some of this learning material, which is good. You've got that sorting out in your Russia. I wanted to try and create. Well, the long term vision is to create an educational platform to be able to help connect these, let's say, the unbanked or people who haven't got the opportunities what we've got and try and do it bridge the gap that way, really, by using maybe the EOS blockchain and effect force as a micro task platform. So it's a way in there. So I've been on the site and I was having a mess and play around with it a few weeks ago and it's quite clunky. There wasn't a lot of tasks on there. So I'm just wondering where we are with that. Is it going to be more counterintuitive? Well, it's countercuitive at the moment, really. It's not a great user face, is it? It's not a great experience when you go on there. So I'm just thinking, what's happening with that and obviously moving forward, I'd love to obviously use Effect Force as a way of them to be able to earn an extra little bit of income. And it doesn't have to be a lot, it just needs to be a little bit for them. And that's going to transform the way they live their lives as well. Because they, like, their average worker earns say, $5 a day, an average farm worker. So you can see the impact you'll make by just helping them get going with us and educating them on how to use the platform. So that's why I'm really with that.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

In regards to user interface, I think.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Unfortunately, David isn't here.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

There is a bug that gives me this error. I think they're working on it. As for this red prompt but yeah, as for tasks, there actually are like a bunch of I've seen tasks that are not, or rather batches that are not yet complete. So it means we need more workers.

#### Rochelle

Yeah, at least for the socials. On the socials, yes. But David's on vacation right now. But I do have updates. Lawrence has been working on a lot of the interface, user interface updates. It's going to be cleaner, it's not going to be so clunky. It's going to be easier to navigate and know what things are better explained. So I have a bunch of how to guides for workers and requesters, but they're on hold waiting for Lawrence's UI updates and things to go on because if I write them now, it's not going to work in a few weeks because it's going to be completely different.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

It may be useful to how to.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Guides on the site as well, like as a tab or something.

#### Rochelle

Exactly. And so that's what I'm going to have on there as well. We're going to add like a watermark overlay on the task previews for Effect Force because I've noticed some people are confused. They think they did the task, but they really didn't. They're just looking at it and doing it in the preview and nothing is really distinctive showing them that it's just the preview. They think they're in the real task. So that's being fixed. We're going to try to where is it? On the app menus, I think, yeah, the app menus are going to be a little bit different. So instead of like, oh no, I fixed the one, what else.

#### Richard

Can we access this from a mobile phone and say, an iPhone or a Samsung? An Android? Or is it all basically for a laptop or a PC? Windows.

#### Rochelle

Mac going to be for both. And what we've noticed is even on a laptop or a desktop, the whole page, it doesn't take up the whole page. It's like really oddly centered and there's all this extra white space around that shouldn't but then it looks normal on the mobile site. So that's going to be fixed. What is it? There's gonna be, I'm looking at the placeholders. There's a couple of other things that I think we're working on, on our Dev tickets thing on GitHub too. But there's going to be a complete redesign and it's going to have better ways for workers to understand how to do things, requesters, understand how to put their tasks up. And then also the Dow stuff, how people could get into the Dow, know what's going on and it's missing all kinds of information like click where to go for your help, where the documents are and the guides and things. So all this is being updated. I can give a better update, I think, later this week from Lawrence on the exact specifics because he's really good at explaining it all better than me with that.

#### Bree

Nice to see Lawrence on this call and explain here like he said he would.

#### Rochelle

Yeah.

#### Bree

Seems like these UI updates are just taking forever.

#### Rochelle

Yeah, he's in a time crunch to get these published out ASAP because then all kinds of other content and things can be created once he gets that. So he's under a lot of pressure from Moi and everyone to get these through.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

It may be good to have kind of the UX review also be like a sort of task, I guess, so you can get worker input on the user interface, definitely.

#### Rochelle

And then I think too, also, I think we were going to have a real time thing of the fees to getting paid into Page as well. There's so many updates, but right now, yeah, we do need some more workers to do the social tasks, but the big push with all the marketing stuff and the networking things with other projects on EOS is to get more people to put up tasks. So.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, you may I sent a message before, but yeah, if you need workers, you may also consider sending a message to Jesse from Eosbs because I know there's probably some overlap and the people that want to do the B stuff and are open to doing tasks, I think.

#### Rochelle

Yeah, I think so.

#### Richard

Sorry I lost you all there. Can you hear me again? Yes, sorry about that. They just went quiet. The phone rang and it just shook all the audio off. Sorry, where was we again? You said you was going through the UI and showing all the user face out and getting the app sorted. So the last question I think it was, will this be ready in, say, three weeks for the 26 April? So I've got something then to show when I'm over there. Just a bit of training for the.

#### Rochelle

Kids and the people in the pool, I'm hoping. So I'm going to get with Lawrence tomorrow to kind of get an update that I can relay all to you guys and also get his status on how far he is with these. And I'll make sure I tag you and let you know.

#### Richard

Brilliant.

#### Rochelle

26 April, right?

#### Richard

Yeah, I'll go on the 26th. Right. I've been also speaking to Gabby a little bit about some videos. We got a studio, obviously, we need think effect force needs to have a lot more exposure and a lot more engagement. And we know this, but we've got obviously a small market budget or no market budget. So Evan's putting sweat equity in, which is great. Everyone's trying, but I think I can probably utilize that if there's something I can do. What's missing now? We need to have more engagement. Obviously. We need more how to's we need more content out there. Whether it's videos format, which is great videos, they're engaging. So I've got a full studio, even podcasting studio. We can do all sorts of things, maybe get creative. So I've got that. So I'm thinking if there's anything you specifically need, maybe just let me know, even if it's an idea. And we can maybe go through there through that. And also partnerships. What's the one thing we need now? The most important thing is it partnerships, do you think? To be able to get some traction, to be able to get some movement so people know where we are, who we are. So I can collaborate. I've got a good network of people, but I just need to understand how I'm going to add the value to them by them coming towards, you know what I'm saying? I'm still uncertain, really, of how I can add as much value as I can. So I need to be attracting the right people to affect force. So is it more request as you need, like, companies, so you need more brands?

#### Rochelle

Basically, yeah, we need more people using the platform than workers because then the workers will come quickly.

#### Richard

Yeah.

#### Rochelle

What I like to shift it is for the longest time, you remember with the project, we were talking about getting partnerships and things like that. Well, now that it's completely decentralized, the platform is now it's not so much partnerships, it's getting companies to use the platform. They don't have to partner with us, we just want them to use the platform. So now our marketing focus is on exposure and onboarding and supporting people who are onboarding using it. That's where the big focus is because that's how we as a Dow and a project can make money with network fees by people using the platform.

#### Richard

Yeah, absolutely. I'm with you.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. Being a partner is like the Dow can't really get into a legal agreement, I think. So the best Dow can do is endorse something and give people a grant of EFX. Right. That's what I've done with some EOS.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Projects with that social page.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

It's like we're endorsing the ENF and a partnership. I don't know, it seems like in crypto it can kind of be kind of like a really big buzzword.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Basically. Having a dialogue is good enough, I.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Think, just like say we.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Are doing and they say we like what these.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

People are doing and just communication and.

#### Rochelle

Usually a partnership, it means both sides are giving something. Well, it's better to try to get them to use the platform because then there's no risk or commitment to them. And hopefully if we're supportive enough with them and giving them a grant of EFX that they can use on the platform and helping them set up their tasks and things like that and helping them that way, then maybe they'll continue to use the platform and really love it and hit it off and there we go. So I think that's the most thing is outreach and advocating and support and getting people to notice us and use us. That's our biggest focus right now.

#### Richard

Yeah. Sorry, is there any sort of what you're aiming at? What sort of request is for any specific jobs or do you just want any? At the moment, it doesn't matter. Have you got like, something which you think you couldn't literally shine in or it just could be anything across the.

#### Rochelle

Board, anything that people can complete remotely?

#### Bree

Anything?

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, I would say anything, but I.

#### Rochelle

Think.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Well, I guess I can update.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

On what I'm working on. The grant, I think it was like two weeks ago passed and I've been using GPT Four for a lot of the Python and it kind of blows my mind.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

How good is it's going to revolutionize?

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

It's going to revolutionize software development, at the very least, because I already it's so much better than Chat GPT, like 3.5. It barely makes errors now. SPEAKER F

Is it actually writing your code? For a large part. Hey, everyone, by the way, sir, I just made it in here. Is it really useful DJ, or you're like, is it programming, like the logic and the structure?

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Well, yeah, mostly, yeah.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Basically, first I was like, basically, when you write programs, you can write out like, the pseudo goat, like, what you intend to do logically, and so you just do that and then say, write it in Python and it will generate the Python script for you. For me, the hardest trouble seems to be just when I get into what it's called dependency hell on Windows, I'm trying to figure out why is it not working? But in regard to generating code, it's very good now. Well, there are some things it can't do because it's so recent. The latest thing I figured out is how to run the clip interrogator locally. So now, using my GPU, I can run it to figure out the content of an image. I figured out how to do that locally, so I figured out how to do every single component on Python. Now I just need to build the whole thing. The only thing with Jack GPT, the GPT Four, is that it can't do like really big it's not so good where it just connects into your IDE and you can just have it generate everything, but I feel like that's going to be the case within six months because it's that impressive. So it's really helping me accelerate. Anyway, I think with my idea is that I'll be able to generate these indexes and have EOS side people will be able to find these images. But I think it's that network side, this could be a good source of tasks that we subsidize. And then ideally my goal is in the future to kind of start going to the Ocean Protocol meetings as well because they're a data place marketplace. And so I think one way to outreach to them would be just to be posting good sets of data there because when I look at their marketplace, the data they have would be like stuff like prices, which is I guess, useful, but other than that, they just have public domain data. So I feel if we generate an actual unique data set and post it on there and then start, we can kind of try to collaborate and see if there's other people interested in having data sets created for them. I think that's the service the Dow can help do. Like for example, Richard, unfortunately, we can't sign a legal contract, but I do feel like it could be useful if the Dow could pledge to create a type of data set or something for someone. Maybe some university needs a data set because there's a lot of research going on in AI and they could use data sets. So I don't know if we can get an endorsement if we produce a certain type of data set. That could be something worthwhile. Another thing Richard to consider is so I pitched this idea to Jesse. The ENF has I don't know how much you're aware of it, but they're pushing the EOS EVM a lot and basically it's just the ethereum that's embedded into a smart contract on EOS and people can use like a made a mask and it's just like all the other ones, like polygon. But anyway, the ENF has like 20 million they plan to invest. And so another thing of news is I've been looking into Dora Hacks, which is another hackathon venue, and they have zero cost for hosting hackathons. And actually they seemed very enthusiastic about helping facilitate a hackathon. Seems like very low cost, basically as a way for them to also gain traction. So I think I recommend Jesse talk with them more. But anyway, my idea was so this is something I'm also pitching to you as a Dow member. What do you think of, say, selling over the counter from the Dow to an entity, a lump sum of EFX in exchange to be used for something? So, for example, with the ENF, my idea is say it will be like 20 million EFX for like $250,000. And this $250,000 is used to facilitate hackathons on door hacks to build EOS EVM like DApps as a prize money, not in one but like say over three years we have one hackathon every quarter, something like that. That's like an idea I had. And Jesse said he pitched to UVES. I don't know if it's necessarily one that will be a hit, but it's an idea like that.

#### Richard

Yes, great idea. Because we need to really raise money to be able to get some traction, don't we, to put it into the right things. I was thinking even a small raise, I was thinking how can we create a small raise? Just like say but we need to directly target what we're going to do, you know what I mean? So we're more specific with what we aiming at, really, like you just said. But yeah, it's a great idea. That is.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Jesse said if we're something like that would require a contract and the Dow can't do it. But Jesse did say that the foundation could do something as a proxy for it.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

And so I don't know what can come about of this, but that's just another idea to consider because I know basically I do think yeah, definitely. SPEAKER F

And I'm in favor of the idea. I think if you look at Effect Networks to economics, there's two really large pools of tokens. One is the treasury of the Dow and one is the tokens that are managed by the foundation right now. But these tokens are like they don't have a purpose right now, but they might be really useful. If you can imagine if we could swap a part of the Dow Treasury for USD over the counter for a stablecoin or EOS or some other tokens. It would give us a lot more, I think, firepower to give hackathon price money or to attract other talent from different industries to work on effect network and to be more involved. So I think it's really a worthwhile thing to explore if the markets are healthy enough. And I think right now it's a good time to start thinking about something like that because with AI coming up and EOS getting back into shape, I think it would work out timing wise. So I'm in favor. It's definitely a discussion to have with the Dow members. And like DJ said, if for contract wise, the foundation and the Dow, I think it makes sense if the foundation would be involved, because that would give any EOS network foundation or someone that's interested in investing that amount, some security, like because there's an entity to sign that's a bit more stable and less risky. I think in that sense. So it would make sense to do that sort of together. But I definitely think the Dow should be very involved as well because there's a lot of tokens in the Dow and it just makes sense to have that be a leading party.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yes. In summary. So if you think there may be a potential way to, I guess, exchange a big portion of EFX in exchange for funding to. Build out something like Hackathons or Central.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

I think the Dow should do that.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

To secure the funding because I do feel like we kind of are lacking funds. If those funds can be translated into development I think that will help out a lot.

#### Richard

So how much do you think we need? Like 100 grams worth say USD or 250,000 USD worth? What's your target? You know what I mean? Do not be perfect. Now it's just thinking out loud because it basically can use that as a collateral then, can't they? And maybe go to VC or somebody who potentially lend against obviously FX, what's in the treasury, say, to the amount of what we want? That'd be ideal, wouldn't it?

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, it would all depend on the terms. For me I'm thinking primarily I'm hoping.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Jesse can get into a really good.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Conversation of the door hacks point of contact because for me it's what I envisioned when the Dow first began.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Right? Just hackathons. Right.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

The pipeline. So I think if we have it.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Wouldn'T even need to be much if.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

We could say have just $10,000 base.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

For a hackathon, just USD. So no matter what, we don't know how the volatility of EFX goes. At least their price pool has $10,000.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

That will encourage at least 20 people.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

I think to participate.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

And then with that every quarter we.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Could have new applications that we can talk about that use the fact Force and our DApps that we can show off that this is a working product and if Effect Network does well we can increase the price pool with the EFX. But we'll always have a base. Right. Because the problem is we don't want to have too much of a price pool now because if we have a super big price pool and it's only EFX, the only way they can really have access to the reward is if they sell it right. And this will just kind of be pretty bad to economics wise if every quarter it's done that way. But if we have even 100,000 I think will be enough to just secure this pipeline. Especially if door hacks allows us to do it very cheaply.

#### Richard

Yeah, definitely worth thinking about. We just need to go traction on it. Obviously it's not my field, the developer side, I'm more introductions, collaborations, so called partnerships, whatever you want to call them. But I'm here to help and do what I can really. But I need to be guided as well to where you want to use most of the energy, where we're going to put it, you know what I mean? Where we're going to aim at because there's so much you can do. We're all busy. So it's about being most efficient, isn't it? Invest bang for book, really with your time.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. Alternatively, once we get one hackathon going, if we can just find sponsors as.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Well that maybe they want to have.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

The DApps be like a certain theme or something they contribute, say, X amount of money to the price pool and then the DApps built can be like a certain theme, like game five or research or anything. Really?

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

I don't know. Not telling you to go for anything specific. Just like telling you what potential things could work. SPEAKER F

Yeah. And I think it's really important who would be interested in that. Right. So for the ENF, for me it makes a lot of sense because we're based on eels and we've been on their blockchain for a long time and they obviously have a lot of benefit. If Effect does well and does a lot of transactions on their platform, it creates a lot of traction for them as well. And even a hackathon on Effect Network is making use of eels. So people are basically investing in both projects, their time and their energy to build something, which is what the hackathons are for, to establish. So I think that will be an amazing partnership. And it makes sense for the Dow to give tokens and to get funding back to finance these hackathons. I really like where that idea comes from. So that's a specific one I really like. But even as long as the projects involved have some benefit from Effect Network right. If it's a gameFire project that needs play testing or needs something with the human input element that they actually need Effect Network for, I think that could make very valuable partnerships. And hackathons are a great platform for doing these types of things where programmers can experiment and develop quick applications for different industries. So I think it's a really good angle for these types of for finding funding, basically for finding funding from the Dow.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah. On that note, one minor thing. So the proposals that passed the ATPs, we had an issue where they expired too quickly, so when executed, they wouldn't work. So I think Jesse published another one for the D Five box A resolution instead to have that money sent. So like a separate ATP? SPEAKER F

Yeah. Maybe I can quickly explain I wanted to discuss this. I have to jump off in about five minutes because we have the Twitter spaces and I have a little prep before, but what happened is we created these ATPs which are basically EOS multisig transactions. But when you create these transactions, there is a deadline into when you can execute them. And the method we were using to generate the transactions put the deadline a bit too early. It's a bit of a silly bug. So it means that after the voting and after the high guard voting on basically executing the past proposals, we cannot execute them anymore. And it's a technical issue as we need to make sure that these proposals, the ATPs, are at least valid for the volume duration and the cycle duration added together. So, yeah, it's a bit of an annoying issue because the Dow has voted these proposals in, right? They've gone through like we've discussed the proposals, we've put them out there, we've voted on them, they've clearly succeeded. But now the ATP on them has expired, especially on the D Five Box one. It's kind of an issue because those funds had some priority. We wanted to get them to D Five box shortly so we can move forward with the marketing initially. So one way to solve it would be first of all, the technical issue we're already working on, we'll have that solved really soon. So it's like basically I made a mistake creating these proposals because I didn't pay enough attention to the expiration dates. But we're going to make sure that that cannot happen anymore. But for the proper solution would maybe be to create these proposals again, post them and then we have to wait another time, another two weeks until they're approved. The Dow would have to vote again. But it feels a bit silly because first of all, Dow members already voted on exactly that proposal and it's already approved. And to me it feels this sort of fits the label of a technical issue where this shouldn't have happened. But because it's basically the first ATPs that got created, this issue only shows now. And I feel that it would be more beneficial for the Dow but also for us Dow members to not be exhausted with all the voting that has to happen on things over and over. I think we should have a High Guard resolution. That was what I proposed to basically recreate the transaction that the proceeds execute and have the high card photo in it to pass it anyways. So it's basically mimicking the exact same transaction. The high card resolution would have to accept that and then we can still execute that transaction which at the moment we can still do because with high card resolutions we can basically we can bypass the proposal system. So that was the solution I wanted to propose. I put it out there already in the High Court Discord channel. I'm not sure if everyone can see that but I can link it as well. In the main channel there is a link to the new transaction to be executed. I'll also write a proposal about it as DJ suggested, like to communicate clearly that this is happening. But that was my solution and I think to me that makes sense. As long as we communicate transparently what's happening, we fix the technical issue and we will use one High Guard resolution right now to fix these two proposals that are not able to execute because of the expiration. Then sort of we can move past this issue, I think. But of course this is a Dow sort of matter so yeah, we need to discuss it and would love to hear what you guys think about it or if there's a better way to go about it.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Well, it seems like you only got a couple of minutes left.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

So I think we'll have to leave.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

It for the next alcohol. SPEAKER F

Yeah, the next alcohol is in two weeks which also would be like kind of too late. I'll be here for two more minutes. If there's objections then that would be good to hear. But also just yeah, we can of course drop it in discord or even have another Dow call a bit sooner than in two weeks to make sure it's okay. But I'll definitely write this out so people can read it. There's not like.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

What a resolution is because I was actually surprised that you can actually do that. SPEAKER F

Well, like for example a code update for the smart contract at the moment if you look at the permission structure for the Dow, it's possible to execute to do for example code updates to the contract and that technically they don't have to be approved by the entire Dow. And also in the constitution it mentions these high Guard resolutions for making these type of changes. We once had it before when recovering the stolen funds for a Dow member where we basically updated a contract to recover stolen funds that were being unstaked by a hacker. These are like the sort of resolutions that bypass the proposal system and they need like a signatures from the effect team.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

I know I approved your MSIG but I feel like we shouldn't normalize using the resolution systems for inconveniences. SPEAKER F

While it's true that's fair, it may.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Be bad that we're I mean I think like since the foundation has its funds, like I think the foundation could just send it and it just kind of be all like combined together into the monster bill that we owe the foundation. So I don't think it's necessarily like an emergency.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

I think it'll be better if you.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Just I think the number two option basically maybe the foundation just sends the EFX and everything the Dow owes the foundation can be done in another ATP that's not expired. SPEAKER F

Yeah, no that's definitely also a good option because what happens in the future if other you're like I should push this too much because I made the mistake right and I made the Dow proposal. So for me, I really want to hear what you guys think about it but I totally get what you're saying DJ. So for me that's also totally fine and maybe it makes maybe it's the better option.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, that's my feeling on it because it's not like that big of a deal. I think to need a resolution.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

In.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

The future there may be other cases where it's past expiration and I think it should be again have a resolution if other people in the case like maybe other ATPs happen. So yeah, I guess that summarizes and I don't want you guys late for your Twitter space.

#### Bree

Yeah, resolution should be really thought out. You just need to quickly fix something that's not a resolution. SPEAKER F

Well, if something's broken, then I think it can be fixed. That's what resolutions are for. We should fix it with, like things can break, right? Things can get hacked and things can break. So how I see it, if there is a mistake in ATPs or doesn't work as intended, well, it's clearly that the intention of a proposal was this. This should have happened by the code as we kind of agreed on, but something else happened. I feel that needs to be fixed, and I think that's where resolutions can that's exactly where they can help. But I also totally agree that this is not a really important one. It's not urgent. We can actually get around it. Maybe we shouldn't even touch that. So totally fair. Yeah, I get that. I think I agree.

#### Bree

Yeah. I'm not saying if something's broke, don't fix it right away, and a resolution might be the way to go, but I do think there needs to be a sense of priority, importance, I guess not saying don't use a resolution the last choice. SPEAKER F

Yeah. All right. I think there can be two camps in this. I maybe see it in a bit different way, but I totally get the way you guys see it. So, yeah, I'll definitely not push it too hard. Try to get this through. I think hearing what you guys think about it already makes me realize, all right, it's not necessary to push a resolution or something like this. We can just do it in clear, a bit more slow way, and that's maybe the better way for the Dow. All right, sorry. I'm going to go to the Twitter call, so do listen in if you can. And, yeah, sorry for being here so short. Next time I will be here the full length of the call. Bye, everyone.

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Bye.

#### Bree

Bye. I want to listen to the Twitter space.

#### Rochelle

Should I schedule another Dow call for this coming Wednesday, a week from today, that maybe we can talk more about resolution stuff and things?

#### DJSTRIKANOVA

Yeah, you can go ahead and do that.

#### Rochelle

Okay, I'll do that. I'm going to.

#### Bree

Put that on an agenda.

#### Rochelle

Yeah, I'll do that. We'll call it Biweekly Dow call 2.0 bye.

#### Bree

Should be continued next week.

#### Rochelle

Okay. So I put one on the 12th.

#### Bree

Okay. All right. Twitter.com.

#### Rochelle

Okay.

#### Bree

Next week, guys. Bye for now. Bye.
