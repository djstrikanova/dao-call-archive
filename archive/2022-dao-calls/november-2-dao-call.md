November 2, 2002 DAO Call Notes

No current proposals Two proposals pending: approval for funding the farm; DAO 2.0 passed

Some updates:

* Launchathon registration closed
* Launchathon presentation deadline pushed back
* DAO 2.0 passed
* Paying back the loan to the foundation passed.
* Effect Socials updates (incorporating feedback from users.)
* Effect Force performance updates

The SDK has a lot of functionality. It can be embedded in other tools.

DJStrikanova was asking about how to use the sdk in order to get back to the original vision of Effect of providing Machine Learning algorithms to Developers can create their own interface to use Effect Network instead of the Force. Other platform tools can be utilized through the Force The front end is just a wrap around the force, so the SDK should be able to be implemented where/when ever you like.

Create a proposal for recycling funds for the Farm. (Needs more explanation)

GitBook needs updated. This could be divided up into small jobs. Aleks will update proposals. Bree will update hyperlinks and landing page. Bree to speak with David about URL from Effect Docs.

Discussion about whether to alternate times for the meetings, one early and one late. Generally, no change is desired to current time, unless there is someone specifically requesting a time change. Discussed having an emoji vote to have an earlier DAO call time for the next call.
