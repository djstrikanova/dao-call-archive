# October 19 DAO Call

Author: DJSTRIKANOVA\

Recorder: Bree

My short summary: DAO Call 10/19/2022

* Using Tik Tok as an outreach source, but is not that active. Effect Network does have a Tik Tok.
  * David advocates someone make a proposal to make videos for Tik Tok
  * Discussion over BSC slow-downs and issues. Due to technical limitiations BSC can't really avoid all the signings, but relayer has been spotty lately with time-outs being too short for a transaction.
    * Idea of flow of users trying things out with BSC, but optimal experience happens on EOS
  * DAO 2.0
    * Election of High Guards
      * Committies
      * Arbitrary DAO transactions, ie. electing high guards, sending EFX to a target.
  * Discord Forum Updates\
