My concise summary of our call DAO Call 9/7/2022

* Network Fee's delayed, but will get utility that shows fees coming in in real time.
* Launchathon in progress, Catalogue Dev waiting for Shopify to confirm his app, NFT labeling apps developed. Instagram now available on Effect Socials.
* People dropping in getting help adding NFT tasks on discord.
* Record breaking amount of people using BSC to complete tasks, it crashed because EOS needed more RAM/CPU. Fixes made to optimize BSC transactions
* Discuss future landscape of recognition of artists who contribute to data sources for the ai art generation. How to use NFTs for royalties for building up a bot that creates art. (Just speculation about future)
