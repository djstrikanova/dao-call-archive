DAO call 5 october&#x20;

We are thinking of doing the dao call one hour earlier compared today. That way it would be a tad easier for some of the active participants to come and join.&#x20;

Next time we do an earlier DAO call it would be: 8.00 AM CET We need to work the announcement and do it on time.&#x20;

But the next DAO call will be 19 October at 17.00 CET again.&#x20;

We will discuss the follow up DAO call afterwards. Members that are present are Bree, Aleks, Jesse and David.&#x20;

\# Proposals&#x20;

\## 95: Developer Pool for DAO Development [https://dao.effect.network/proposals/95](https://dao.effect.network/proposals/95)&#x20;

A developer bounty program and encouraging more community driving development. It's a push from Effect in order to get more developers to work and improve the dao, doing bug fixes, features.&#x20;

The force should be the primary focus, it needs to be a strong product and the dao will come along. The dao members feels that the Force should be the priority.&#x20;

But there is also a sense that the dao could be much more, and there are many updates that are needed. And the Dao needs more engagement from the community.&#x20;

\## 110: EFX PancakeSwap LP Reward Farm #5 [https://dao.effect.network/proposals/110](https://dao.effect.network/proposals/110)&#x20;

\# How feasible is it to do the PCS lend from the Foundation? The abstain votes are really high on the proposal. How will the Foundation get it's funds back? Would the foundation need to make proposals in order to get funds back from the DAO?&#x20;

Aleks mentioned, It was assumed that Jesse would delegate the loan payment back to the foundation. The loan would be a 0% interest loan. Aleks is sure that the DAO will pay back the Foundation loan, when the DAO commits, as he has confidence that the DAO will do it. Within the question of the scope it is more that the DAO is asking the foundation for a loan if it is possible.

## Other comments

### Will the fee carry over?

It's still on the backlog and needs to be worked on.

### What are the major todo items?

A couple of things Effect has done is.

* Effect socials update
* Effect Image labeling dApp
* Update with effect Templates
* Adding NFX to the DAO is almost done
* Helping launchathon devs
* DAO bountyboard
* Boilerplate for launching new dApps

### launchathon

Now that the launchathon is ongoing, and locked in. There are no definitive plans at the moment for doing a Hackathon. But it would be nice to have a hackathon 1st quarter of 2023 now that mainnet is more stable.

### Are there any contracts with Kraft Heinz?

Effect is in contact with Kraft Heinz, but there are no contracts with KF at the moment. Since the pivot to building a decentralized Effect Network, Effect has stopped taking assignments from them.

### How does the high guard work?

It's been a while since the last high guard meeting, but we are talking about revamping the high guard system.

### Did we hear about FCC

Are there any TOS in order to protect Effect Network and or protect the Effect Network legally from a plaintiff. Just because Effect is decentralized, we do need a TOS in order to make sure that users, workers, requestors are using the platform as agreed upon in the TOS.

Effect network needs to make sure with the current political climate we have the proper safe guards that would ensure users do not abuse the platform. Or that Effect does not end up being in the cross hairs of a international agreement.
