## Topics discussed:

### Funding infrastructure accounts: { validator, relayer }

Suggestions:

* Use cycle fees, so each cycle eos would be bought using efx funds
* Host a relayer in order to run auto power up, this would be done by each user
* users would loan eos resources to the validator and relayer account
* Collect transaction fees that the relayer can keep

### Hackathon for business development

Good idea, we should consider it in the future. Figure out what kind of hackathon we want to do again in the near future, in order to entice the old hackathon participants. Figure out timeline, voting, tooling, prize money. We should use the dao voting system.

### NFX

We discussed Alex' and Alan's ideas on how to change the dynamic of NFX. By either doing a buyback or introducing an inflation to NFX. Or both. We need to figure out the best way to stimulate growth of the DAO and Effect Network community. One option would be to transfer the NFX funds from the foundation account to the DAO account. Think about adding multi token support for the DAO account, in order to support NFX.

### EOS nodes

We need fallback nodes or proxy nodes in order to keep the network healthy when nodes or connections time out.
