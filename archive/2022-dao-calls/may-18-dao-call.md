Bree:



1. Today's DAO meeting was short. with no recording.
2. _\[_&#x31;0:58 A&#x4D;_]_&#x50;roposal 101: Need to call all who volunteered together to set up the channel and to decide upon the initial rules. (Even if only the admins) will likely create a separate group channel for admin and mods to communicate. Will aim to let the TG channel grow organically, however, ground rule should be created. - There could be a subscription fee required for the /bot services. - We should look at having a bot that can share posts with Discord, perhaps a /command. - thank you to those who volunteered to be admin and monitors. Please contact me if you were one of the volunteers.
3. _\[_&#x31;0:59 A&#x4D;_]_&#x50;roposal 102: funding for the next farm cycle has been approved with enough yes votes to move ahead with the farm. One cycle will be skipped before requesting the funds for the next cycle.



1. David and I discussed some options for burning tokens. While burning network fees are not a viable option any time soon, we discussed the possibility of auto burning and holder reflection on purchase/sale of EFX, or NFX. With the Network running over two chains this would present challenges. the DAO could perhaps have reflections/burn on the EOS chain with stakes in the DAO also being given reflections and reflections/burn on the BSC for BSC-EFX holders and trades.
2. _\[_&#x31;1:11 A&#x4D;_]_&#x48;owever at this time, the priority of time is still being given to getting the mainnet released without bugs.
3. _\[_&#x31;1:11 A&#x4D;_]_&#x49;f you haven't noticed yet, there is a running feed from Github now.
4. _\[_&#x31;1:13 A&#x4D;_]_&#x45;xpect more team communications to come more frequently. There are many small celebrations that happen and to be had that need to be communicated with the community.

DavidB:

Hi all, Indeed Bree and were at the DAO meeting today and had a chat about the ins and outs about what's happening. We noticed that we've been very sparse with our communiction and are taking steps to improve this. We've been working in the background, but we know that i can seem as if nothing is happening. That's why we've incorporated the github feed, that it's a bit more visible. We've been hard at work with the qualifications recently, and want to showcase it soon, so please do stay updated for what's to come! Stay stafe and stay tuned!
