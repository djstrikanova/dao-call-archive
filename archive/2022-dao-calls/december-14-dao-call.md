# December 14 DAO Call

Unfortunately, our Chrome plugin Verbosey crashed from trying to store a recording 1.5 hours long. Will need to fix this for the next DAO call. Here is a short summary from our memory of the call. \
\
Author: DJSTRIKANOVA - Rochelle\
\


* Discussion of all the members running for the DAO. Rochelle, David, Jesse, DJSTRIKANOVA, Bree.
* Consensus that minimum amount of HG role is voting on proposals to prevent malicious actions and also being active in Discord and Telegram. HG can then pledge to do more on the various committees and over time as the DAO grows they may be challenged by others. However, we don't want an antagonistic relationship. Those that want to replace a HG should advocate what they can do better.
* Other potential HG applicants include Gabrielle, Miguel, and Laurens. Discussion of Laurens needing to be much more active in discord/telegram for him to get support. DJSTRIKANOVA says he intends to vote no on Laurens for the time being.
* It's preferred that all DAO HG applicants get in their proposals by the next cycle, but not mandatory.
* Discussion of whether DAO should have elections every period of time or just operate under endless terms with a recall or resignation needing to be initiated by proposal.
* Discussion of how Encryption of tasks results could be done. Companies could put their tasks within an iframe that's displayed in the campaign. Once a task is complete a "completion code" could be provided while the actual task result is stored on their end.
* Effect Force Notifications by DJSTRIKANOVA working and needs some optimization updates, will be ready to go live on Effect Discord and specialized Telegram channel in the next week.
* Discussion of AI Datasets being a huge potential source of tasks for workers during the AI boom
* Rochelle is working on a proposal to update the constitution for HG election process and the recalling of HG members.
