SPEAKER A

One. So many screens, so many tabs. Where is it? Do my find feature. My computer is running slow. I got past stuff starting. Okay, so DJ put advocate for the foundation to participate in AssemblyAI hackathon and he listed a link. So I'm really interested in this. Do you feel like filling us in more detail about it?

SPEAKER B

Yeah, sure. AssemblyAI is just like, one of the many startups using the AI services to do stuff and they in particular offer something effective to offer except like much cheaper and much better. They have a tool that can transcribe any video or audio into like transcripts. You can just plug it in and anyway, they're having the tackathon with prizes for the top three where you have to build like some sort of tool using all these various sites that offer these AI services. And so my idea was if the foundation could whip something up and participate, maybe that'll be a good way to have outreach for all the other AI people participating in the competition. And then like ideas I had in particular with AI, a lot of the micro tasks we've been doing last year are kind of the workers will be in direct competition with the machine and generally the machine will do better in regards to cost and speed. And so the only way that workers can compete is just validation. At the end of the day, you still need a human to look at something and say, okay, that's right, so that we know that humans actually look at it. Especially when you have like big amounts of data or you want to find what's wrong. Like when you're testing your AI models, the best way to like, improve with this to figure out what case is, where does it say the wrong thing? And that's where a lot of humans workers can really come in and shine. And so I think it's a three day hackathon. And so from what I've read, we're not allowed to prebuild anything. It's just they want you to have an idea, buy the hackathon and then hack it together. In a few days it's active, so it's not like it should be anything super big, but I think if it's like a small little thing, they can contribute. Me and Miguel and Abu Masa Abyssamat also are interested in participating though I don't think we have yet sold on idea but I advocate for the foundation to try it out as well because I think participating in things like this and using a second network as, like part of our repertoire of tools for building stuff, I think is a good way to have outreach to other developers.

SPEAKER C

Perfectly to developers.

SPEAKER A

Yeah, I think so too. And I'm looking at their website and it says, what is an AI powered product? And it says innovative products and projects that leverage new AI models. Think like Jasper, Lexicon Runway. And I'm vaguely familiar with Jasper, so I'm wondering if we could build like a task model on Effect that uses I don't know if it would work, like uses some kind of AI to like split up an existing data set. Like a requester could put in a data set and it would use an AI model to split it up into tasks and then those would be put on the network for workers to validate that data that the AI is being trained on. Something like that.

SPEAKER B

Well, what's viable or not? I'm still getting my feet wet in the field, but yeah, definitely something relayed to the Jesse and Lawrence and the rest of the team. What do you think, David?

SPEAKER D

Yeah, I'm looking at the website right now and it seems like really slick product that they're offering and I think it would be a good way to market ourselves as well into the space to make our presence known within these circles.

SPEAKER A

Yeah. So we would register as the Effect down. Right.

SPEAKER B

Well, so they have teams and I don't know what the foundation would do. I guess you could, but pretty sure to affect that.

SPEAKER A

I think maybe that would be the best way. Like the Dow is the team, you know.

SPEAKER E

Is there a cap on how many people in a group? Just trying to see here.

SPEAKER C

How many.

SPEAKER A

People can be on team? We can have up to four people on one team.

SPEAKER D

Yeah, but it seems interesting. I'm not really seeing or getting a lot of ideas right now at the moment, but I do think it would be an interesting way of incorporating their API somehow with effective work. I think that would be and it.

SPEAKER B

Doesn'T have to be their API. I think they said they're going to release a more exhaustive list of what you're allowed, like what they expect you to use, but I feel like it's going to include hugging face too. I think there's a prize for the best project that uses their eye. They have a secret fourth price and that's like five k, but I think they generally just want some AI model usage of stuff that's online. So that kind of gives you more options for the ideas.

SPEAKER D

I do agree that we have to power up Effect network, especially the Force with AI as well somehow. And all of the tasks that we're doing right now can be easily done by AI instead of workers and just completely mitigates what we're trying to build.

SPEAKER A

Yeah, I think so too. I think we should join as like the Effect out and even though it has like four members, I mean that we just would delegate four of us that are going to participate and really do the work, you know? But of course it's like a complete group effort. More than four people.

SPEAKER D

I'm available that weekend and I can work on it with you all.

SPEAKER B

For you that weekend too. The only question is really just what's the idea how do we divide up tasks?

SPEAKER A

Maybe go by skill set. Like I can't code a program, but I'm getting like strategy, an idea, like right, it writing up.

SPEAKER B

We also would need to form multiple teams because unless it's going to be Meadow, Miguel and David, I mean, it's like there'd be more teams, I guess. But for now I think we just got to focus on ideas though. I've registered, like, if you're interested, you can register. There's no team like registration. It seems like you just got to have a team. But it's not like you tell them who is your team member. You just register there's like the top event thing and you register. And then after that they don't really ask anything else thus far.

SPEAKER E

I guess they do ask an additional information company.

SPEAKER B

Yeah, I just put like a site down.

SPEAKER E

Maybe if we go in as the same, like, company, then I'll show that we're in the same team. I'm not sure how they're putting people in teams.

SPEAKER C

If you registered Effect Out as a team, could you have more than one team for Effect Out?

SPEAKER B

Well, we did register Effect as a team. They asked what company do you work for? And I because I don't want to just put my full name and identity, I just put DJ Strike, Nova Effect Out.

SPEAKER C

Well, that works. At the moment, there's only so many developers highly engaged in Effect, but this is one way to change that work toward changing that.

SPEAKER B

Well, the other thing is it's going to be tricky because a lot of communities have strict we don't want crypto talk, right. So we have to finesse it by showing them like valid demos of use cases.

SPEAKER C

Honestly, in my personal thinking is the fact network was never, strictly speaking, a crypto project. I always thought about more like the token one was like EFX was an in house token and there still might be ways to have that for other people.

SPEAKER B

Well, I don't know if other people really see that distinction immediately, but I mean, this Effect network is different in other projects.

SPEAKER C

I think it is. I think the entire dollars.

SPEAKER E

I guess now also because Effect is more decentralized since going on BSc, then there's more correlation with actual crypto. But I see what you mean by in house dollars before because it's more centralized.

SPEAKER C

Well, no, I'm not even thinking that way. I guess unlike Canadian Tire dollars, you don't have to use them where here you have to use Effects. But at some point there should be onboarding and outboarding into the network into using EFX that my mom could use and not even know she's using crypto. Just access and enter through PayPal or some other intermediate that can access crypto without the users even realizing it.

SPEAKER A

When we were talking about some of the UI upgrades for the Dow interface and then on the Effect Network app, we had talked about having a thing where you could buy EFX, like a button buy EFX and load your account. And it would just do it from USDT or whatever and it would just put in the info for buys and stuff. We talked about having that because that would be handy right on the page there if you don't have it but you could quickly do it instead of having to do everything.

SPEAKER C

Yeah, but keep in mind for Canadians, you can't use a credit card. The bank will stop the transaction if they think it's anything to do with crypto.

SPEAKER A

The same here in the United States are crazy.

SPEAKER E

I think it depends on your bank. Some banks are still a case, some are not.

SPEAKER C

Both of mine are not.

SPEAKER A

Mine are either.

SPEAKER B

Debit cards usually that only are allowed.

SPEAKER E

Yeah, and debit cards are allowed. I'm with CIBC and my cards always.

SPEAKER C

Been fine, but I know that's my problem.

SPEAKER E

Yeah, RBC bemo they do not like crypto.

SPEAKER C

Security and you say, hey, can you please let this go through? They're like. No.

SPEAKER A

Katie bank doesn't either. I have to add cash in coinbase and then I can instantly buy crypto if I add cash. So I usually add cash from my PayPal which is connected to my other stuff and that's how I do it.

SPEAKER C

Is it shake pay? Yeah, I just pay like an e transfer.

SPEAKER E

They're really cool because they also pick up all the fees for big deal, transferring, sending, buying like anything and they're amazing. And if you shake your phone once a day then you get free money.

SPEAKER C

Yeah, like we should, I don't know, something like shakepay, Shakepay's really good. You can pay credit card or you can pay e pass or whatever. It's really fluent. It's just that they only have Ether or BTC as options. Yeah, it'd be still nice to just go directly.

SPEAKER E

That's the ideal final product of the Dow website I think is for it to be like a one stop shop for whatever you need. You don't have to go to pancake swap, you don't have to do anything, it's just going to all be there. But it'll definitely take some time to get everything connected and perfected as we want.

SPEAKER C

Well, effect network if nothing else. It's time, but it's a glorious product if you're patient.

SPEAKER D

Yeah, I do agree that it should be easier to get into EFX or out of it. And I think that should be USDT and there should be an embedded bank swap interface where you can swap out your EFX into the token you want. We shouldn't focus on the integration with the traditional finance system. That seems like an overhead that might bring more trouble than is worth it, I think.

SPEAKER C

Well, maybe at this stage, but at.

SPEAKER B

Some point well, the tricky part is getting these machine learning developers in, because they are not like the crypto natives, and they like so my theories are that decentralized AI. Is going to come in the future, but for now, the centralized is going to pop up first because it's easier, you know, just use the centralized server to do, like, your AI stuff.

SPEAKER C

Well, imagine if we can actually get in there and compete with that and make headway as a decentralized organization.

SPEAKER A

Ecommerce stores have those payment processor apps that they put on so they can accept customers payments in like all different forms and stuff. A lot of those are crypto ones too, where you can buy coins. Yes, exactly.

SPEAKER C

Coin payments. I'm not sure if it's Etsy, but you can use it as a merchant and accept crypto.

SPEAKER A

Yeah, but then the Dow would have to have pay for that service. Well, yes, and that means it needs a fiat bank account too.

SPEAKER C

So you either pay for that service or your developers make you the service.

SPEAKER A

I just don't know how the Dao would do a fiat bank account.

SPEAKER C

The same way to do a crypto one.

SPEAKER B

Oh, no, it can't really work that way.

SPEAKER A

Yeah, I don't think that would really work, sorry.

SPEAKER C

Maybe the same way something like Shakepay does they manage yet? I don't know how they do it.

SPEAKER E

Yeah, I'm not sure. They must have specializedation because especially with e transfer, I don't really know a world where you can not e transfer to a bank and have to have a bank account run by them.

SPEAKER C

Well, one day there might be a conversation we're having where these little fees were third party use.

SPEAKER A

Yeah, but right now, for right now, I think pancake swap integration button I think would be our best step.

SPEAKER E

One thing we also have to keep in mind with that though, is that we're kind of steering everyone towards using BSc in that case, because then that's using pancakes, you have to be on BSc. So just I don't know if we want to do that. If we don't want to do that, what do we do with people who want to stay on EOS? Do we try and get away from, you know, those are all things that.

SPEAKER C

We have to have one option for Es and one option for BSE. Yeah, two buttons.

SPEAKER A

We also talked about putting it in the worker interface where you could have your multiple wallets, you could have your BSU wallet and your EOS wallet and then just choose which one instead of having to make two different worker accounts. Because I think all of us have two different worker accounts, one on what we do now. Yeah, but that would be nice, especially for just qualifications.

SPEAKER C

Actually, I think I've got about three BSD accounts. That's why I keep getting messed up and confused and going on and why can't I do this task? Oh, I don't have any qualifications in this one. Oh, I have to switch account.

SPEAKER A

I know, I do it too. But yeah, back to the hackathon thing, I really like this. And we've got what is it a Monday meeting? Computer froze Monday meeting and I think everyone is going to be in it and I'll make sure we mention it and go through it with the other team.

SPEAKER D

I'm imagining that will make some kind of DAPT or a campaign that uses the AssemblyAI.

SPEAKER A

I think a whole other gap because that would look really nice on the ecosystem page too.

SPEAKER D

Agreed.

SPEAKER B

Don't make it too complicated. You only have three days to do it.

SPEAKER A

Yeah. Putting the depth on the ecosystem of connections we have that pretty much cookie cutter replicable.

SPEAKER D

We do have that template that we could potentially use, but indeed, three days isn't that much and I think it will be just enough for proof of concept.

SPEAKER E

Yeah, it's not going to be refined very well if you have to make it from scratch in three days. Sure.

SPEAKER B

Yeah. I'm not sure what their rules are, but when I asked them, it should.

SPEAKER E

Be very vague still.

SPEAKER B

Yeah, it is vague so far. Like I asked them is the intent that we think of an idea, then build in three days? And they're like, yes, so definitely keep that in mind.

SPEAKER E

Simplicity is key then.

SPEAKER A

Yeah. So like a proof of concept, some barebone stuff, and then a glowing presentation I think would be best way to do it. Yeah, absolutely.

SPEAKER B

If we do the test, we need all of us to be on the side there to do them too. So they're like quick turnaround.

SPEAKER A

That would be no problem.

SPEAKER D

Yeah, I think it depends. I think people are working there, so I've noticed that depending on the time of day, people will do the tasks, especially like the easy ones. I do notice that your tasks aren't going that quickly, but people are willing to do the easy ones at least.

SPEAKER B

Yeah, I think mine are only one AFX. I'm not too surprised.

SPEAKER C

Yeah.

SPEAKER E

I guess people are looking to dive.

SPEAKER B

Into what we're talking about. Sorry, go ahead. I was going to say that kind of dives into what we were talking about before notifications. And so I was thinking like, build, like because I have my dial, I have like one digital ocean node droplet. And I was thinking just like to create a service that monitors the effect SDK. It will use like a database and basically if there's a new, like a new batch if that's true, then it sends the notifications to whatever service we wanted to use. And so you're talking about this email service that's like free or something.

SPEAKER E

Yeah, I was looking at a few of them and I found one that was like completely free. But there's got to be a catch. I was trying to see what the catch was, but I couldn't really dive too deep into it because when I tried to test, like sending emails and stuff, I need a verified domain. I don't have any verified domains myself right now, or any domains myself. That they can verify.

SPEAKER B

Maybe like a promotional thing, like they want to get you in for free, but eventually they're going to lower it and you'll be dependent on it, so you have no choice but to pay. I said before, with Brazil.

SPEAKER A

Now on the oldest centralized platform, we had that notification or email thing where it would be a pop up for when they logged in and then it would also email them, but I would have to create the email. So we had it on the centralized system. But this new decentralized Effect Network, you don't put your email on anything really.

SPEAKER E

But I think, well, it would be like an optin kind of thing, so users would have to go and actually opt in to the notifications. And then while you're opting in, you're putting your email that you want to be sending.

SPEAKER B

Yeah, like that's. Like I'm only assuming right now, but I remember like vaguely that you can list out all the tasks right now using Effect SDK net, right?

SPEAKER D

Yes.

SPEAKER B

Yeah. So it's just I got to put it on a database so I know what's new. The distinguishing what's new and what isn't is like the only real thing you need to do.

SPEAKER A

Yeah.

SPEAKER E

I don't know how the data is shown on the SDK because I actually haven't experienced being on the SDK, but it seems like just a simple, like parsing the data and checking if something's different.

SPEAKER A

If we made a field for people to enter their email address on Effect Network, on their Effect account, it would go on the blockchain. Right? Recorded on the blockchain. It would go on the blockchain.

SPEAKER D

If we add that field to their virtual accounts.

SPEAKER E

Yes, we could potentially you don't need to though, right?

SPEAKER A

Well, there's no back end.

SPEAKER B

That's because they want to have it decentralized, right?

SPEAKER E

Yeah.

SPEAKER B

I'll do. Like SQL Lite or something simple. Well, that was also another reason, I think, for what the foundation can do. It would be Telegram, because you don't necessarily need to opt in into emails. You can just add a channel for whatever campaigns you want to subscribe to.

SPEAKER A

Yeah. And then it would just be like a Telegram announcements channel.

SPEAKER B

Yeah. And so there'll be announcements whenever tasks are posted and then you can go and that way there's no need for emails or anything. There was one guy that requested emails, but as you said, we're going to need to collect the emails and if we want to keep that front end completely decentralized, we're going to need, I guess external service. I'm thinking I can set it up. I think I know what I need to do. I just need to do it. And I'll make sure I'll post my initial thing on GitHub so you can look at it too, Miguel.

SPEAKER E

Yeah.

SPEAKER B

And then I guess we can work together on a little bit.

SPEAKER E

Yup.

SPEAKER B

And I'll can paste, since I might doubt Effect out that school domain. I think I can just use that for the notifications for email. I don't know how busy you all are, but I mean, cause I think if I get emails, I can get the Telegram channels discord stuff as well. Really?

SPEAKER E

Should we add like a notification thing on Discord, too?

SPEAKER C

Yes.

SPEAKER E

Because I know, like Rochelle, you post when tasks are going up too, but that's manual posting. I'm wondering if we should add a bot or just add to the Discord bot already.

SPEAKER C

The effect bot manual. I was looking at the Moderate, and I know Rochelle knows everything about this, but I was just looking at it myself and it looks like we can use one of the bots on an announcement channel and Rochelle would know how to because she had it and that's free.

SPEAKER A

Yeah. And if you do it just announcements only. It's free.

SPEAKER E

Okay.

SPEAKER A

It's like $8 to moderate. Yeah. I still have the moderate going because I use it for other things that will come to light later. But it's really easy for me to add another channel and then create the Telegram channel announcements only for tasks and then add that on my Moderate account. I already have.

SPEAKER C

I was looking at it because as more people are joining the Telegram, more and more, I'm not recognizing names.

SPEAKER A

Those were bots. Those three.

SPEAKER C

I know. So it felt like a bot and I thought maybe it's time that we had a bot.

SPEAKER A

Yeah. The good thing with that Moderate thing is if you have it going for an Announcements channel, I can create a key and basically form a team that has access to that moderate announcements thing. So it wouldn't be like, oh, only Rochelle could control it. It would be whoever is going to be active with this. You guys all have keys to log in and do things with it.

SPEAKER E

Yeah, that sounds like it'd be a good idea.

SPEAKER B

Wait, is that for manual control or syncing it up?

SPEAKER A

Both.

SPEAKER B

Okay.

SPEAKER A

Yeah.

SPEAKER B

I'm still thinking of implementation wise, I could just make a makeup. I don't know. I was thinking for a second I could just make an API. So I wonder if we could just like yeah, never mind. Forget my thought. But I lost my train thought. Sorry.

SPEAKER A

If we build a DAP and get tasked on the platform to use for this hackathon and we're worried about workers joining, we'll have no days ahead and I can just blast and harass everyone on the platform. Hey, there's going to be tasks, stuff like that, to get it going.

SPEAKER E

Yeah, this is more so it's not for just the hackathon, it's just because we were speaking about it yesterday that it would be like a good thing to add already.

SPEAKER A

Yeah, definitely.

SPEAKER B

Yeah. Because like, with the tasks, I'm pretty sure workers aren't really met. I think they're kind of expecting notification because we can't expect them to check the site every day.

SPEAKER A

Yeah, this is something that I've wanted since day one when I joined the project years ago. I'm like, we need notification. I've been yelling about it and what was it he used to work with forest. Oh, my God. I met a loss for his name right now. This is horrible.

SPEAKER C

Discord. You can have alerts for that particular announcement channel. And then on my phone, more often than not, I'm having to go in and turn off those alerts or updated on little pop ups.

SPEAKER A

I was playing around with my IFTTT, and I was trying to hook it up to where if I told Big Speed that I posted tasks, it would create a notification in Discord with, like, a certain message. I was messing with that recipe because I yell at Big Speed all the time for stuff. And a lot of times when I'll post, like, Twitter tasks, a lot of times I'll forget to post and discord. Hey, I put tasks up and do the link. So I was trying to automate it with that, and I'm, like, in the middle of it.

SPEAKER B

The main idea I have is you can subscribe to any verified campaign for notifications.

SPEAKER A

Yeah.

SPEAKER B

Discord or telegram for now.

SPEAKER A

What about Unverified, too?

SPEAKER B

Yeah, well, I mean, let's see. You can subscribe to any campaign.

SPEAKER A

There you go.

SPEAKER B

You just need to send the ID and it will give you notifications. And then maybe with that we can add a button so that it's easy for the workers to do. I'm not sure how we get the workers to do it because I'll have to build or will they have to go to a new site by site.

SPEAKER E

But in that case, that means that the workers have to go and manually subscribe to each campaign. Would it be better, do you think, to just have in general, whenever some new campaign or new tasks come out, that it just notify them?

SPEAKER B

Well, I think maybe there should be an option for just all, because I know I used to try to capture there are, like, telegram channels that you can follow for video cards and they tell you when it's dropped on any Best Buy or Target, whatever.

SPEAKER E

Yeah.

SPEAKER B

And I was following eight different cars, and it has been annoying because they constantly give me a notification. They will get a notification, and five minutes later it will be sold out. I feel like some people may want to just do only certain types of tasks. Others will want to do any type of task yeah, that makes sense.

SPEAKER E

Or the tasks that they actually are qualified for, too.

SPEAKER B

Well, if I get the V account, then I could do that, I guess, right?

SPEAKER E

Yeah, I guess for the time being, it could just be general, just so we have the concept down and it works, and then we can refine it after. Yeah, but just having notifications there in general is already like, a really big thing.

SPEAKER B

And I don't think it will be too tricky. The only unknown right now is how easy it is to use the FX SDK. But I vaguely remember dealing with the task. I think you should try it out too, just locally to pull the data. We can let David know if there's improvements because that's what on David. I think the best thing we can ask for is just improvements to make it easier for us to get this information.

SPEAKER D

Yeah, it should be relatively easy for you to get new batches. If you have the campaign idea, you can just pull it every five minutes or so, for example. And indeed if there's a new entry, then you can easily check for that and then push a notification. So it shouldn't be too difficult. Indeed.

SPEAKER E

What happens if because I think right now we're talking about like it's already been pushed and it's like visible on the website. But is there a way to like when the requester actually submits it? When they click that button or whatever, like the final button that whoever clicks for it to go into the eyes of the public. Like when they click that button, can that then send like a signal to then send notification about that task or that batch that's been put up?

SPEAKER D

Yeah, that's possible, but not all batches are created via the front end.

SPEAKER E

I see. Okay, that makes sense.

SPEAKER D

So I do like the idea more of having a server somewhere that would pull and watch the blockchain for new batches. And then from that you should easily be able to recreate the link, retrieve that patch on Effects Force.

SPEAKER E

I'm going to have to look and play around with SDK then get familiar with it.

SPEAKER B

Yeah. The next few days I'll make a repo. It's going to be like something I run locally first. I'm not going to try getting on the server and it will be just the SQL Lite, a text database and then it'll just like and then it'll just be a script monitoring the effect SDK, as David said, just checking every five minutes and building a database and creating just a function that says send out notifications. And it'll be just like a console log. I think once we get that done, it will just be yeah, then you.

SPEAKER E

Know, okay, it's working. Then instead of the console log, it's the thing to send the notifications. Right, that makes sense. Like it.

SPEAKER D

Notifications. Have you ever enabled that?

SPEAKER E

The what?

SPEAKER D

Sorry David, that the front end can make system notifications. So at certain point there was probably a permission that you had to choose to enable that and I was wondering if anybody enabled that.

SPEAKER B

No, I always disabled that just as a habit. Me too, because so many other sites have been like, no, I don't want that. So I probably disabled it.

SPEAKER E

Yeah, I don't remember seeing any anything like that. So I probably disabled two to have.

SPEAKER B

It. Yeah. Like I wonder if you could like have like in the settings just like a way to pre ask the question or something. But that only works if it's like a tab, right?

SPEAKER E

Yeah, I think it's you have to have to be open. It's not going to do anything if the tab is closed because it sends the message through the tab and then you can select a chime or something or whatever. But it has to be open.

SPEAKER D

Exactly.

SPEAKER A

Okay, we've got what, nine minutes left scheduled for this call, but I want to quickly talk about the post I put up in Discord about the highgard election process. Did you guys read it?

SPEAKER B

Yeah, I read it. I'm wondering who wants to run? But Gail, do you want to run?

SPEAKER E

Me?

SPEAKER B

Yeah, you.

SPEAKER E

I mean, I don't know what I would run for. I think that's right there would probably be other people that are more well versed than me to be a high guard for tech.

SPEAKER A

We can have multiple high guard members in every age community, and I think that's going to happen. There's going to be a lot of overlap right now while we're young, do it.

SPEAKER C

Here are my thoughts on it. As I make this up, as I start to wake up, think about what you're already involved in. Don't create work at this point. All we're really doing at this point is saying, hey, I'm kind of doing this already. So I'll put my name in a commitment to say I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing anyway. And as we grow it as we need things, we just do what we need to do anyway. But we're really just saying to the community, all right, we've been on these Dow calls for how long? And we really believe in this and so we're going to stand behind it. That's all it is, a statement right now of the commitment.

SPEAKER A

Well said. Well said. That's exactly what it is.

SPEAKER B

The other thing is oh, sorry to you.

SPEAKER C

Yeah, I was just going to say I'm going to run at some point when I get my head around actually creating a proposal for the marketing, but I would say I'm not good at marketing. But right now I'm currently managing the Telegram, so that's under that category and the organization like the management one, I'll probably run for that one too, even though I've not been strong in that lately. But I'm feeling better, so might start getting back into that.

SPEAKER A

Well, when we're talking about this, Jesse and I, and then in the meeting with the rest of the team and Miguel, you were in there. Of course Jesse is going to run. He's going to put up his proposal thing. Lawrence, we were teasing him about his down call attendance and stuff and everything and yeah, I'm pushing for him to run too, because he does a lot of stuff. He's just quiet in the background.

SPEAKER B

Well, the thing is, our Dow participation, I think, is a record lows right now. Only 17 people voted in the last two proposals, I think, two cycles. And so, like, the High Guard is like was it nine people? So 50% of the voters are going to need to be High Guard. Right. So I think we may struggle just to reach nine. Because I don't want to run because I have 35% votes here. I don't know, I feel like I.

SPEAKER A

Think you should run.

SPEAKER B

I don't know.

SPEAKER A

I think you should, because you're in it all the time. You're actually doing things, sourcing things, coming up with good ideas, actually creating tools and stuff. I think you should definitely.

SPEAKER C

Be on the High Guard. I agree with Michelle.

SPEAKER A

I'll even write your proposal stuff saying why you're qualified to do it. I'll help you with it. Yeah, I really want you to run.

SPEAKER C

I know Allen has expressed concern.

SPEAKER A

Of course you guys know I'm running because I'm the one that started all this shit with the 2.0.

SPEAKER C

Yeah, well, actually, I disagree with you, Rochelle. I think I started it last year, got the season.

SPEAKER A

I have did I have the Telegram chat? I shared it with you. Yes, but we talked about this. Bree and I have been independent for a year.

SPEAKER C

The two of us have been talking about this for the year or longer. And DJ, you are absolutely the one person who should be on it because of your engagement, not because of your weight value.

SPEAKER A

Kind of think about it. Breeve, you and I were talking about this way back, even when Chris was in the discord calls.

SPEAKER C

Oh, God, no. We've been talking about this since the very first call I attended, I think.

SPEAKER A

I think so, yeah. Afterwards, when the call ended, you and.

SPEAKER C

I were on for an hour discussing this.

SPEAKER A

Yeah.

SPEAKER C

DJ, you're the type of engaged person who absolutely needs to be honest. This is about showing commitment, and your weight value also shows commitment.

SPEAKER B

Well, that's the thing. There can be a perception of consolidated power. And I feel like if I run for the High Guard, the perception of power being consolidated is definitely going to be pretty high.

SPEAKER C

But the power is an imbalance right now because people are anyway, I'll keep it.

SPEAKER E

I think if that becomes an issue, you can always just step down to relieve the pressure that the community would be putting on. You saying that you have all this power, right. It's not like, set in stone.

SPEAKER B

Yeah.

SPEAKER E

Because obviously we know that's not the thing. Right. But the community might see that. Okay. Your voting percentage is this high, and you're a Dow and you're a High Guard member, and it doesn't mesh well with them. You can always step down and kind of relieve those thoughts from the community.

SPEAKER A

I'd be the most vocal person if that comes up. Definitely. I'll be a classic American hillbilly fit. And just put them in their place. Because it doesn't matter that you've got the 35% or whatever vote share and stuff. You've been showing up for two years, you've been building tools and stuff. And I'll just tell them, okay, just quit it.

SPEAKER C

You know, this is about skill and commitment. This has nothing to do with vote weight. And if the High Guard actually has to override something, your vote weight doesn't come into it.

SPEAKER A

And most of the time it's just talk and no action. Because if somebody was really determined to put a stop to your vote share, all they have to do is just amass a bunch of EFX and NFX, no matter the cost, if they're that motivated and get more.

SPEAKER C

The more people who are doing, the less weight is your vote.

SPEAKER B

That's the thing. I don't think part of it is just participation, because I've been looking at the unstakes and people have not been mistaken NFX as far as I see. So really, just like half the people just stop the size voting. And I guess cause I don't know, maybe the rewards aren't sufficient, they think. But yeah, part of it's just participation of existing Dow members is also low. Aside from the core, the hard core, as Elon would say, like, there's a.

SPEAKER C

Few people, I don't know, everyone I can think of that I would really go to personally and say, look, you really need to commit to something because your value is required or needed. I saw voting on this last vote. These are the guys who are still active, they're still engaged, and they might not be on this call, but they're still participating. And you're on this call. I'm on this call, but I'm able to be miguel is on this call. I don't know if I say that right. He's always engaged and interested, but he doesn't like being on the call. David, Rochelle, Jesse, Lawrence, you guys should be on the High Guard as well, or at least the working committee. I know Rochelle likes the highgard. I would love to change that someday. Anyway, as Dow members, nothing to do with the effect of AI anymore. That's their own business. They can do whatever they want with that, as far as I'm concerned. But as Dow members, they should be on that committee as well. The strong core, committed people should be on that High Guard in one of those committees. And it's got nothing to do with both weight.

SPEAKER A

Yeah. And that's why I started really formalizing this dow 20 thing, because it's to, one, give recognition to the people who are active and actually doing things and showing up, and two, as a motivation to help grow the dow in an organized manner, have people committed to doing outreach, have people committed to helping build tools and onboarding and people committed to making improvements and things and get rewarded for that. And then if we're all organized and we're accountable for these things. We're actually doing them. More people will join and get involved, and then we can have our own little autonomous committees, and it will just grow the network and grow the Dow and make the Dow more in control of the network. So that was my big motivation because I've been passionate about the Dow since it started.

SPEAKER C

I really believe if this is going to be truly decentralized, you still need an organizing body.

SPEAKER A

Exactly. When the first High Guard was formed and delegated, it really, honestly pissed me off because it wasn't going to work, and I knew it, and I couldn't get anything to change. So that's why I'm like, no, we need an active High Guard who actually does things instead of just monitors and vetoes something. If it's bad, it's got to be more for a doubt of growth.

SPEAKER C

That's one of the reasons why I don't think Highgard is an appropriate name for the whole body of committee. It's appropriate.

SPEAKER A

Yeah. Because it's not really guarding anything anymore.

SPEAKER C

No, it's not. It sounds like a policing name.

SPEAKER A

I know it does. So that's why the name change and stuff. We can do that later. Yeah.

SPEAKER C

Once you get active, a name is just a name, but a name sets the tone.

SPEAKER A

Yeah. And see, the initial High card wasn't even assigned with the blockchain. It was not even done on chain or in a decentralized manner. So that's why this is needed with the arbitrary transaction stuff that Jesse's been working on to release that way, it's on chain. It's decentralized. It's how it should have been from the beginning.

SPEAKER C

I still think we should be tracking income in and out on something other than just the blockchain. Yeah. It's all there, I guess.

SPEAKER A

Yeah. That's part of the dot dashboard UI improvement that's going to show the fees coming in and stuff and a breakdown of from what, like, tasks or say we do this hackathon and we win a price. Then it's got to have a place to track, like, what Dows brought in.

SPEAKER C

Because I think we need to be as a I don't know. I've used the analogy of, like, a nonprofit business before, and I don't know if every nonprofit across the globe are managed to run the same way. And I know the blockchain holds you in account, but it's not really an accessible way to see quickly.

SPEAKER A

Yeah. Nonprofits, they have to, I think, show their books and what they got and donations and what they granted out and stuff.

SPEAKER C

Audit. Every year they have an audit. Yeah.

SPEAKER A

So I think adding those things on the dashboard I think is good, too.

SPEAKER C

Happened overnight.

SPEAKER A

But back to the running for election in the proposal and stuff it's just throw it up there as a sentiment and then the vids hackathon script that he did it'll gather the winners for winners is a totally weird name for what we're doing, but it will calculate the up to nine people that we can put on a proposal that has arbitrary transactions to assign the height.

SPEAKER C

You already basically have stated that you're going to run for the what is it? I don't have it. No, not the tech one. The organization management paperwork, one proposal tracker.

SPEAKER A

Or the admin committee. Yes.

SPEAKER B

Wait, that's the admin. I didn't know I was doing it.

SPEAKER C

That's part of the admin committee's duty.

SPEAKER B

Oh, well, yeah. I mean, I just kind of did it because it wasn't being done, and I was kind of annoyed by that.

SPEAKER C

You're very good at doing it and apparently very quick at doing it.

SPEAKER B

I mean, if the admin committee is just posting what's been done on that Get book, I mean, I don't think that's too big of a deal for me.

SPEAKER C

No, that's what I'm trying to say. It's things we're already doing.

SPEAKER A

Yeah, humans are hardwired to name things.

SPEAKER C

I know I'm behind on doing things I want to get done, but I have a really good excuse for that. But all you're doing is saying, I'm kind of doing this already, so I'm going to sign up for that committee. All it is is showing commitment. You're not really signing up for anything you're not already doing.

SPEAKER A

For me.

SPEAKER C

We just grow and we adapt and we take on more tasks as we're able to. And if we're not able to and there's something that really needs done, then we go and promote and try and encourage others to fill that role that we need.

SPEAKER A

Exactly.

SPEAKER C

Which we do anyway, successfully or not successfully, but we're doing it anyway.

SPEAKER A

Like, Miguel, I could see you on the tech committee because of all the stuff you do already with the developer dashboard tickets and things like that, and then I also see you on the Admin committee because you're also an admin here in Discord.

SPEAKER C

Yes. So it's really just saying, okay, I'm going to run for these committees, and this is why I'm running for these committees, and I'm already doing this ABCD, and I want to.

SPEAKER E

Basically I forget, did we say that? Can you be High Guard of multiple committees at once?

SPEAKER A

Yes.

SPEAKER B

Okay, but what does it mean, run for this committee? So when you say your High Guard, you're going to tell your emphasis on something because all High Guard is going to be equal in position. Really?

SPEAKER A

Yeah, all High Guards are going to be equal in position. When I put up my proposal, I'm going to start out why I think I should be a High Guard member. And then I'm going to say, I plan to be super active with the platform committee, of course, with the tasks and the validation and all that stuff because that is my passion. But I'll also be active in the Admin Committee doing X-Y-Z and then, of course, in the marketing because I can help do writing and blog posts and social media posts. And stuff like that. So that's like what I would put out in my election proposal and then submit it.

SPEAKER C

Yeah. So just mention stuff that.

SPEAKER A

You'Re either.

SPEAKER C

Already doing or, you know, you have the skill set to do if you have the time to do it or to neither side.

SPEAKER A

Because then when we elect the High Guard members and actually assign them on the blockchain and stuff, I'm going to have like different post, like different roles for us down members here in discord with the tags of the committees. That way if down members have an idea like what they want to do to join, of course they'll go in like, those forums, but then they can also see like, who's High Guard and what. Like their specialty is. Like, say they don't know us very well and then they know who to like, reach out for to start getting more involved in stuff. So that's something to do too.

SPEAKER C

That's one of the reasons why I don't really feel Highgard is an appropriate name because it doesn't encompass what really we're doing. It's more like the executive branch of governing body.

SPEAKER A

Yes. I think we'll all come up with ideas of what to rename it and put a poll in this course.

SPEAKER B

It feels like Dal representatives, do you mean?

SPEAKER C

Yeah, anything that doesn't say, hey, we're.

SPEAKER B

Just leasing you guys because they're basically a Dow saying, we want these people to be leading rules.

SPEAKER C

And.

SPEAKER A

If someone doesn't put up an election proposal to run and I really think that they should run, there's nothing stopping me putting a sentiment proposal saying, hey, I want this person on the deck.

SPEAKER C

Yeah, well, it's kind of like an embarrassment encouragement for that person.

SPEAKER A

Yeah.

SPEAKER C

Not a boat.

SPEAKER A

I'll do it.

SPEAKER C

Okay. Yeah. We'll have to put you up for about DJ. If you don't do yourself but things that we already know you're just you're already doing.

SPEAKER B

I think I'll be preferable if you ask me, somebody else pick you up. Yeah. Because I don't know.

SPEAKER A

Okay.

SPEAKER B

Yeah. I appreciate it because as I said, I think it's because it's like I'm aware of it because people have complained and it's like I can't really do anything about that. It's not like I'm going to not.

SPEAKER C

Both put one up, but you have to like we can do a sentiment.

SPEAKER A

That's what they all are. Yeah, I have to put mine up. I'll put mine up tomorrow and stuff. But yeah, they should all be as a sentiment proposal and then yeah, I have no issue with putting up a proposal saying, look, he needs to be a High Guard member because of this and this. And then I'll also put on there like words about if you're worried about his vote weight and then put my argument there. So to squash it yeah.

SPEAKER C

This has to be about skill and commitment and what you can offer.

SPEAKER A

I'll write it up, DJ, and I'll send it to you to review and make sure you're okay with it.

SPEAKER B

All right.

SPEAKER C

I don't think anyone who's currently voting will have a problem. The usual two might have been.

SPEAKER B

Yes, actually, maybe I should, like I'm on the fence, actually, to be honest. Maybe I should go ahead and write it for myself.

SPEAKER A

I'll still write one out about my nomination and send it to you, and then you can decide. And if you decide to run, maybe take inspiration writing from that. Do what you want with it. But yeah.

SPEAKER B

All right.

SPEAKER C

And we can always really support you in our comments section of our boat, which I still think that little add comment has to be far more visible. Yeah.

SPEAKER A

Anyway, we need to put that as a suggestion in the UI for a post.

SPEAKER E

The add comment on proposals.

SPEAKER C

The add comment under the boat is just a little line of text, and it should be a large button.

SPEAKER E

That's an easy fix. I can do that.

SPEAKER C

Yeah. For old people who are blind.

SPEAKER A

And.

SPEAKER E

Actually, when I was looking at because I saw the comments were saying earlier on, how would people add comments? And it took me a second to even find it, so I know exactly what you're talking about.

SPEAKER C

That's not that old.

SPEAKER A

I tagged you, so you can edit in there anywhere. I just tagged you so if you look at your discord notifications, you'll see.

SPEAKER C

New management. Let's see. I see. Okay.

SPEAKER A

There be awful client. We're, like, taking over the discussion.

SPEAKER E

No, I'm here.

SPEAKER D

I'm listening.

SPEAKER E

He's soaking it all up and he's.

SPEAKER A

Going to run, right?

SPEAKER D

Yeah, absolutely.

SPEAKER C

Yup. And I would squash anybody who's saying, oh, yeah, that's just a team running to stay involved more. No, they're Dow members participating, as you should be, whoever that is.

SPEAKER D

Non team members will be High Guard members. But for now, I think this is just the way it is. We're the ones who are involved, and we'll be taking up the torch up until the guy grows enough that other people will also want to run for High Guard position.

SPEAKER C

Well, I think you just hit it on the head, those people who are already involved.

SPEAKER B

Well, if you're successful, no one want to oppose you.

SPEAKER C

That's true.

SPEAKER A

And there's a few people that have a lot of boat weight, you know, that aren't too active, but they listen and observe and sometimes come to the calls and talk about things that I think should be members, too. And you guys are going to laugh at me, but I think Allen should be one.

SPEAKER C

Oh, absolutely.

SPEAKER A

I already told him it may not be popular. Alan and I have butted heads a lot, but I really appreciate his views. And he's been quietly active this whole time and still believes in this project, and I think he should run for.

SPEAKER C

What'S not to believe in.

SPEAKER A

I would definitely vote for him. Yeah.

SPEAKER C

And Richard's quite keen to be involved, but I think it might be a time factor with work or something.

SPEAKER A

Yeah, Richard really has really great ideas, too. I like his marketing stuff and things. The ads and stuff that you guys did. Yeah, he's right there.

SPEAKER C

He should be in the admin. He's doing what he can with the Telegram group.

SPEAKER A

I have a bunch of pre search tokens. God, it's so hard to say.

SPEAKER C

I've had a few people who should be on these committees because I've used.

SPEAKER A

Presearch since they started. So I have so many other tokens. It's not funny. And I could just donate them or give it to him to do whatever was for the Dow stuff.

SPEAKER C

Okay, is there anything formal we still need to talk about before we get overly casual?

SPEAKER B

Yeah, the only other thing is just these proposals for arbitrary transactions. I think we're all kinds of universal agreements. We need it.

SPEAKER C

Yes.

SPEAKER A

Oh yeah. That's like the oil that goes into the network. If the network was a machine. Definitely.

SPEAKER C

Yeah. That's non optional platform committee. Did you just add that in?

SPEAKER A

No, that's been there. That's my baby.

SPEAKER C

Did you change the oh, no. Okay, never mind. Yeah, I got it.

SPEAKER A

Yeah. That is my baby. Because I can't wait to grow that and then have like the validation stuff with the arbitrary transactions and yes, I can't wait to have that validator program and then get down members involved with validating things because that's going to be a big part.

SPEAKER C

The other thing I like about these little committees is if somebody's on that committee and they really can never make these Dow calls, we make the committee meetings when they're able to attend.

SPEAKER A

Exactly. Exactly what I see. These are just autonomous little mini organizations within the bigger Dow. And to get them having their own what is it? Pool of money to do what they need to do with it instead of having to go through a big entire Dow vote. You know, like these committees can ask the Dow for a chunk of funds to do this and that with and things. So then they would have each have their own little pill, I guess you should say. Because we kind of do that with tech committee already with that proposal that we lump sum over for the developer dashboard and tickets and stuff like that to pay it out. The marketing committee is the first committee I can see that would need a chunk of funds to do what they want to do with outreach and advertisements.

SPEAKER C

Yes.

SPEAKER A

They have their own meeting.

SPEAKER C

Yeah. For somebody's time, if nothing else, to create videos and content or manage it ourselves.

SPEAKER A

Exactly. So, you know, each of these committees I can even put stage channels in each committee for them, too, for their own meetings and have everybody be able to manage those and put events for those channels and give more admin privileges to Dal members who are doing things here in the server. So it's also going to decentralize more of this discord server because I don't think it should be down to S team members and Miguel to be able to control certain things. So this is has a great permissioning system that allows for this too.

SPEAKER C

Yes. Even in the Telegram channel I think you can only have one owner and it would be nice to have two or three owners. The admins have full permissions for everything but they don't have the owner anyway.

SPEAKER A

People in the Dow are just going to start having more power to do things and change things, you know, on the network, on the blockchain and even in the server here. So I'm just sorry, I just love doing this stuff. So I view it as an entirely different project. I view it as another like DAP I'm working for and building it's like another part time job. That's how I view the Dow for me anyway.

SPEAKER C

On the Dow dashboard, I know maybe it's really old school but we could maybe have a box of like a scrolling announcement on the maybe it's tied to the announcement channel on Telegram or tied to the announcement channel for Tab or whatever. But I just had a flashlight in my head. Okay.

SPEAKER A

Yeah, something that the back end is on another service or whatever because really the back end of the Dow dashboard and the effect network platform, the blockchain is the back end. So we would have to just connect things with Widgets.

SPEAKER D

But added to the ideas for the Dow front end update and we'll think about it.

SPEAKER C

OK, what do you call that?

SPEAKER E

We can add it to the Revamp.

SPEAKER C

A scrolling text box.

SPEAKER E

Like the banner. They talk like a scrolling banner for like news announcements kind of but not.

SPEAKER C

A banner like a text box. That the most latest you see it on newspapers, like online newspapers. The most latest headline.

SPEAKER E

Oh, I know what you're talking.

SPEAKER C

You can scroll through them and the most recent on top and the next most recent on top. Right. And you can scroll through them but instead of headlines it would be announcements. And maybe it's tied to the announcement channel on Telegram or tied to the announcement channel on Discord. But so if you post there then the bot would automatically add that like the next headline to that text box. So it's not a banner because banners just kind of flash around.

SPEAKER E

Yeah, something that the user can interact with and scroll through.

SPEAKER C

But on the surface all you see.

SPEAKER A

Is like.

SPEAKER C

You would see the one announcement and maybe the top line or two of the next one and a scroll bar.

SPEAKER E

Definitely something that for the Revamped doubt it's going to be easier to implement than right now.

SPEAKER C

Yeah. No, I understand that. It's just an idea that maybe not a curl bar because that might be too old school. But if your mouse ran over it with two fingers or crackpad or something that it would start moving.

SPEAKER B

Yeah.

SPEAKER C

Yeah. Okay, so you guys know what I'm talking about. I'll add that in right now.

SPEAKER A

I have a quick errand that I have to run, so I have to go right now. But if anyone wants to keep talking about some stuff, I can ping them when I'm back.

SPEAKER E

I chose to say the same thing after Run.
