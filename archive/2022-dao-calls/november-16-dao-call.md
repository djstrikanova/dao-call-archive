QuickCat - Catalogue App has went live!

Validation needs improvement, need some way to implement old rating system in a decentralized way. DAO 2.0 is a prerequisite for moderating the platform.

Moderation tasks, how to market this type of service. Hard to compete with huge companies that do it for companies like Twitter. Best off targeting smaller companies with tinier workloads.

A lot of potential tasks in the machine learning community, DJSTRIKANOVA big advocate in trying to figure out how to appeal to the people creating models out of datasets.\

Validation The discussion is about how to validate tasks. Especially now that QuickCat has been accepted on shopify.

We need to take into account the stream in to the platform and build tools to make it easier to curate and validate workers.

The options are:

Building a rating system Outright banning workers Timing out workers

Keeping track of certain metrics such as: Time worked Number of tasks done Account age

Rochelle was speaking on how to curate the Work Force and the challenges that will come up soon.

DJ was bringing back the issue that we need to hook into the machine learning community. Especially with his push recently in using Stable Diffusion tools on Effect Network.

It was reiterated that we should look into doing content moderation for decentralized social networks.

DJ was mentioning that a good way of advertising Effect Network is to focus more on the emerging Machine Learning space. Effect Network has a good fit for curating content. With this emerging space we will be able to provide companies such as huggingface curation of their data to ensure that they have high quality data to train their models on.

Congratulations again to @abdessamad for launching their dApp on Shopify!\
