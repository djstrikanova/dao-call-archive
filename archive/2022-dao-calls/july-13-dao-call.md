Here's a short run through about what we discussed. Please do add anything I missed in my notes @DJSTRIKANOVA @Rochelle | Effect.AI&#x20;

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#x20;

\# Agenda There were no agenda items, so now agenda items were discussed.&#x20;

\# Proposals

\## 105: Support more currencies in proposal payments For sure we will want to support NFX. NFX will definitely be supported if the proposal passes. But there was some push back from the community to support EOS as well.&#x20;

\## 106: Implement network fees The percentage is at 10% at the moment. We don't want the price to go too high, otherwise Take a look at [https://dao.effect.network/proposals/17](https://dao.effect.network/proposals/17), where a toggle was proposed and accepted by the DAO in order burn half of the network fees.&#x20;

\# Other topics&#x20;

\## Migration Talked about if 2 months is enough, we might need to make another proposal to see how the community feels about sunsetting the old force.&#x20;

\## Airdropping NFX to workers Airdrop NFX to Workers for using the force or the DAO. to stimulate growth.&#x20;

\## Stake EFX in order to become a requester If a requester is acting maliciously, their stake can be poached in order mitigate bad actors.
