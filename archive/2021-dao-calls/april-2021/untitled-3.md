**DISCUSSIONS**:

Extending EffectDAO Constitution to clarify IP rights

[https://dao.effect.network/proposals/25](https://dao.effect.network/proposals/25)

Status: Pending

* We are not familiar with the author but feel this is a proposal that should have serious considerations by the DAO.
* What does it mean to own your proposal ideas?
* Once the proposals are approved do they become property of Effect Network or remain the intellectual property of the proposer?
* Should the person who puts in the proposal be compensated with royalties (residual income from copy right or patent) – a limited or unlimited royalty from all profits gained in direct relation to the use of the proposer’s idea.
* Should this be in the constitution?
* Should this be considered at the individual proposal level?
* Does this proposal support open source ideals?

Much more discussion on this proposal is required.

Easter Basket

[https://dao.effect.network/proposals/39](https://dao.effect.network/proposals/39)

Status: Pending

* All present are **not** favour of this proposal.
* This proposal sets precedence for proposals to just take from the treasury without good cause.
* This proposal serves no purpose to further the Effect Network.
* **Counter proposal:** make this a contest to give the remaining cycle rewards to the best proposal idea that supports the forward growth of Effect.

Questions:

1. Has there been any progress toward creating a comment area within a proposal or attached to a vote?
2. Has there been any progress or decision made about linking the Friday worker of the week to Dashboard?
3. To confirm, the current cycle reward fee distribution is only the distribution of 30% of the remaining allocated treasury funds for that cycle. Correct?

* Also, to confirm, the reward fee distribution should also include 10% of the collected Network fees. Correct?
* There were a few questions on the AMA about this topic that were not addressed. As this is a key element to the reward benefit of DAO staking, it can be assumed that there is a valid reason for the Network fees not yet being included. What is this reason?
* Is there a plan in place for “catching up” on the backlog once this reason has been resolved?

1. Other items

**Open Discussion:**

Talks around Chris voting earlier rather than later in the voting cycle.

* Chris will vote at the last second to not let people know how he is voting.
* Pro: Many people want to know how Chris and the team will be voting. Chris and the team have insight that other voters don’t necessarily know. There could be very good reason for the team voting the way they do. If people don’t understand the way Chris and team vote then questions of why could be asked before the vote closes.
* Con: If people blindly follow Chris’ lead, then the DAO may lose some impact as an independent body of thinkers from the team. Chris and team are voting as DAO members and not as team representatives and can vote when and as they please, even vote differently from other team members, there may not be a united team front in a proposal vote.

Would be beneficial if someone representing the team, who really understood the project needs, continued to share on DAO calls explanations on why a proposal may or may not be good for Effect Network. Previously, when Chris has explained why something would be bad for the network a greater understanding of the impact was had.

It is crucial for there to be team representative and engagement, else the vote will end up becoming a ‘vote-for-anything’ just to be able to claim rewards. Should this happen then the DAO could lose respect as a governing mechanism and simply be a reward collecting platform.

* To resolve this: Chris, Jesse, and Laurens commit to all three coming into a DAO call 1x per month (predictable, such as every third Wednesday of the month) to give team perspectives on all active and pending proposals, updates to all closed proposals, and to vet questions specifically relating to the DAO that are not covered by proposals.
* All other DAO calls would be for them to attend as DAO members to participate at their sole discretion.
* This is not to be an AMA. Strictly related to DAO and DAO functions.
  * All DAO calls to be moderated by DAO members – not the team.
    * Team members should not be moderators.
  * DAO calls follow a structured agenda with a moderator assigned to manage the agenda. The moderator for a call could be assigned at the start of each call. The Agenda published prior to the call.
  * DAO members requesting a discussion topics or questions to the team that are not proposals but are specifically DAO related should have these questions already in the agenda 24hours prior. (Posted in the Weekly Call DAO Discord thread.)
  * Call needs to be a prepared discussion, then an open discussion to bring ideas forward and create a collective

Discussion about the Ambassadors channel group: A group with a high passion for the project and a wealth of intelligence and skills to tap into. The core DAO members should be like this passionate about the project, not about the rewards.

* The DAO could have been a natural extension of the Ambassadors.
* This group could be reactivated, revitalized.
* If the Ambassadors were brought together to meet regularly to bring problems up for discussion and find solutions. Some solutions could be to just act on something, other solutions might be to submit a proposal. Other solutions might be brought to the team.
* There are really intelligent and passionate people in telegram who are not in the Ambassador group channel who could be added there.
* If the Ambassador were put to work, perhaps paid with NFX, to attend meetings once a week, to come up with solutions, to work the telegram groups interjecting passion and forward-thinking ideals – to simply be a positive, intelligent presence. There is a real focus on developers, understandably, but the passionate logic is being lost to the reward seekers, and the Ambassador group is a perfect solution to this.
* Have a meeting once each week.
  * Throughout the week in telegram keep track of solution-based comments, keep track of real concerns.
  * Bring these solutions and concerns to the ambassador meeting – to go through, match up problems with solutions, discuss find solutions.
  * There should be a representative from the team at these meetings. Not Chris, he is too busy. But a reliable representative for the team.
  * Find the solutions first, then take it to the DAO. (Such as using the treasury fund to pay for marketing if this is the biggest concern in the community).
* The most important thing is to work to progress Effect.AI. We need a group that is interested and passionate and will bring the best things to the table of the team.
