DAO Call – March 25, 2021

**Summary Notes**

**Team in Attendance:** Chris, Jesse, Rochelle

**Members in Attendance:** ace, Alan, Bree, dorlo, rs043, Vincente Calduch

**ANNOUNCEMENTS**:

* This was a very short meeting with few attendees. Likely due to the fact that there are presently no active proposals.
* (Also, I’m missing the last 10 minutes of recording – so my last notes are from memory. I need to learn not to touch my keyboard while recording.)

Chris is highly busy ATM, he has not had a chance to check all of his Discord DMs, he will get through them as he is able to.

Proposal 37: A guide on how to improve security by using a Ledger hardware wallet

[https://dashboard.effect.ai/proposals/37](https://dashboard.effect.ai/proposals/37)

status: pending

* Fantastic, looks good.
* Requesting 2600EFX, consider the price.
* No real discussion on this. Straight forward and necessary.

Proposal 38: Set proposal submission cost to 10EFX

[https://dashboard.effect.ai/proposals/38](https://dashboard.effect.ai/proposals/38)

status: pending

* 100EFX was set at around 2 cents, the price has gone up significantly.
* There should be a nice amount required to submit a proposal to encourage serious proposals and not just random thoughts.
* Lowering the entrance value would encourage more ideas, but the goal is to have proposals of high value to the network added, not to have lots of ideas.
* It is encouraged that proposals request the entrance fee returned to the proposer, or have the cost of the proposal included in the budget.
* Sponsors could be sought out to help fund proposals where the proposer may not have enough funds, to be returned to the sponsor.
* There could be a request or area for ideas to be discussed – (There is on Discord already, but it is not being utilized to the extent that it could be.)

**DISCUSSIONS**:

Proposal 29: “Worker of the Week” Page on DAO Dashboard

[https://dashboard.effect.ai/proposals/29](https://dashboard.effect.ai/proposals/29)

status: Processing, final vote YES

* There will be a high guard discussion about this, as there are some conflicting ideas about the distinction of EffectForce and EffectDAO, between the team and community vote.
* Community feels yes.
* SEE DISCUSSIONS in March 17 DAO notes for more on this.

Proposal 31: Create Effect.AI plot in “The Uplift” NFT property platform

[https://dashboard.effect.ai/proposals/31](https://dashboard.effect.ai/proposals/31)

status: Processing, final vote YES

Proposal 34: Eliminate proposal fees, instead issue a proposal token

[https://dashboard.effect.ai/proposals/34](https://dashboard.effect.ai/proposals/34)

status: Processing, Final vote NO

* Proposal fees are in place so you can’t spam the network.
* Also, it is clear that people don’t want another token.

[https://dashboard.effect.ai/proposals/35](https://dashboard.effect.ai/proposals/35)

* The result is highly unanimous, so this will go through.
* Shows the values of this community

(The impacted account holder would like to express immense gratitude beyond what there are really words to describe. Know that this action was well above and beyond any desired or hoped for support.)
