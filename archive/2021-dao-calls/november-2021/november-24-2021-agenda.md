**LIQUIDITY INCENTIVIZATION/VOLUME:**

**HACK-A-THON:**

* With the first hackathon extended to 7 weeks, is there any interest to enter a DAO collective team to create an app specifically for bringing income to DAO members (rewards or treasury)?
  * Discussions revealed this was not a good idea. That individuals could chose to support the DAO, but a DAO team would not be appropriate.
