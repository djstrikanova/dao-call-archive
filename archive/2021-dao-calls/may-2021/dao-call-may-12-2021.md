* BSC bridge should be functioning next week.

**Questions for the team** (to be discussed)**:**

* Of the total fiat amount that clients pay for Effect Translate services,
  * What percentage of that total amount is changed into EFX on the market?
* The only thing for certain is that a new swap code cannot be obtained.
  * Is there a time limit on how long swapping will continue to happen for those with codes?
  * Is there a time limit on how long swapping could continue for those with swap code exemptions?
    * Such as team tokens, foundation tokens, or early investor tokens.
* Can we expect to see an increase of Medium articles and other sources of written articles highlighting activities and partnerships.
* Telegram.
  * Lots of criticism about Effect Network not being seen, but there is a lack on saying what kind of marketing they’d like to see.
  * More tg community admins are needed to support concerns, but more so to promote positive ideas through engagement within the community.
  * At minimum there should be an admin on around the 24hr clock.
* How are things going with the hub in Georgia? How are things progressing with Akon?
* Just for clarification, is the treasury what would have been the gPool?
* Would the team be open to an interview style AMA?
  * One or two community members interview the team.
    * Community interviewers with some experience in hosting conversations
      * Similar to the panels in Blockdown
      * Terms of engagement could be pre-arranged
    * Could be pre-recorded.
    * Conversational style, dynamic dialogue
* Possible Effect DAO role:
  * Getting new partners for Effect Network
  * Getting new dApps built on Effect Network
    * SDK needs completed
  * Possible role in marketing

**Proposals** (Active, Pending, and Newly added)**:**

Blockchain Cold Wallet Safety Guide – For BSC & EOS

[http://dao.effect.network/proposals/41](http://dao.effect.network/proposals/41)

Status: Active, Vote: No

[https://sites.google.com/view/effectaihelp/](https://sites.google.com/view/effectaihelp/)

* Currently the vote is no. The cost vs. what is being offered seems to be the greatest complaint.
* There is a strong tg negative sentiment that the author of this proposal is seeking funds without providing a substantial product for the funds. With some suggesting that they could provide just as much for free.
  * In contrast, the author is the one to actually offer the product and the author has provided previous support documentation and has been a positive community supporter.
* It is important to start building Effect Network documents and supports, and to encourage participation within the community.
* We could expect a quality document from the author that is reflected of the ask.

There are no pending proposals at this time.

**Potential Proposals:**

* GitBook annual fee – GitBook has responded positively to the request to be considered as non-profit and has given us access to the full GitBook service at no cost. Thanks, Aleks for setting this up.
* Cost value for time spend on DAO notes and organization
* Developer costs for dashboard improvements

**Past Items for Discussion:**

Tutorials for the Effect Dashboard and Binance Smart Chain

[http://dao.effect.network/proposals/40](http://dao.effect.network/proposals/40)

Status: Closed, Accepted

[https://sites.google.com/view/effectguides/](https://sites.google.com/view/effectguides/)

* This is almost complete and will be added to Gitbook

**Discussion with the Team:**

1. DAO Dashboard:
   1. A few developers in the DAO community have come together to support the team and Effect DAO by tasking themselves to update Effect DAO dashboard.
      1. These updates will include:
         1. Fixing the sign-out upon refreshing the dashboard.
         2. Creating a rewards calculator. (P30)
            1. Jesse will help with this calculator so it works with P22
      2. Possible other updates may include:
         1. Searchable function for DAO members.
         2. Progress timeline for accepted proposals.
            1. To get an account of progress after the proposal has been approved, especially where there is funds involved. To see what is the status of the proposal.
            2. For the DAO see the completion of the proposal’s end goal.
            3. This would give a record of proof.

Track record, a record of reliability

Reputation building

      *
        1. Tracking progress for delayed payout of treasury funds for a proposal, where funds are distributed in phases.

Evidence of phase completion is given prior to the next phase’s allotment is given out.

Especially where there are large funds to be issued.

*
  *
    *
      *
        1. Would also give the DAO a tool to see if someone has completed the task they asked the funds for.

And if not, then the DAO could say no to future requests for funds until after the previously approved task has been completed.

*
  *
    *
      1. Proposal approval notice.
         1. Could be a side-by-side list to see the HG comment.
         2. Post to GitHub a request for this task to be done.
      2. Filter function for proposals.
         1. Create a readable archive to thin out the proposal landing page.

1. There is a developer channel already created in Discord. The team will begin to use this channel to communicate with the DAO community developers to support and give input.
   1. The team will also be more diligent about updating the tickets on GitHub for the DAO developer team to access required tasks.
2. Team primary focus after BSC is P22 and SDK.
   *
     1. The SDK is the number one priority for the team and for the DAO.
        1. A fully conceived and executed Software Development Kit will allow the community and other developers to begin building on Effect Network.
3. Job board:
   1. A Discord channel could be created to use as a job board.
      1. To see if there is interest of use before creating something more complex.
         1. A request page
   2. A possible way to get a lot of small jobs done is to create a proposal for multiple small tasks that requests enough funds to cover all the tasks, then to create a mini job board and create tickets for the jobs to get done by developers, then getting those jobs done in a mini-centralized way.
      1. For example, once the guides already in progress are done and in GitBook, if more are needed then a larger proposal could be made to cover the cost of creating the missing guides and managed centrally by the proposer.
4. Effect GitBook vs. Effect Wiki
   1. Effect GitBook will be for community created guides and tutorials
   2. Effect Wiki is not completed yet. This is officially the team’s and will host important how to documentation and official documents.

**Open Discussion** (without team representation)**:**

* Keeping communication with team open and discussing proposal ideas prior to posting with the team to get a sense of whether the proposal should be redundant.
  * Concluded that best thing is to create a draft proposal then bring it to a DAO call for discussion and getting feedback prior to making it an active proposal.
* Perhaps we could set up a 5 star review/referral system that could be anonymous or public, but comments and star selection is made from within the private client account (to avoid trolls) to be viewed publicly.
  * This might be something the team needs to set up.
  * There are already platforms already set up for this, such as Trust Pilot.
  * This might not be a viable option, might be worth looking into.
* AMA channel questions:
  * Many questions seem to skim around what they really are trying to ask.
    * Questions really need to be asked directly
      * How much exactly a requestor pays to the work force and how much is paid to the BV
      * definition of what is BV and what is Effect Network
      * What is the amount of EFX represented by the 10% fees in the Network.
      * a token flow statement – a financial statement in addition to the token map
      * There really needs to be clarity
* Effect Force:
  * Anyone wanting to completely exit the workforce does so by emailing the team.
  * There are new tasks coming from a new requestor that isn’t translation…
    * Details cannot yet be revealed.
  * Clarification regarding payments in fiat and PayPal:
    * Technically when a requester puts a task on Effect Force they should be paying in EFX and have their own EOS account. But EOS is a nightmare for non- crypto, especially regarding CPU. KH looked at this and said we can’t do this. So a solution was to have them pay in fait.
    * KH is invoiced for the cost of the translations and the cost of the Effect Network on separate charges.
    * The bots make buys for the translation services and that EFX goes into the account to pay the workers.
    * Workers getting paid by PayPal is getting phased out, and is almost completely phased out.
    * When translation services were first set up there was a high need for quality translators, these translators were not familiar with crypto. Because the need for the workers was greater than the time needed to learn, EOS accounts were set up for each worker.
    * As EFX was earned, each two weeks the EFX was paid out and converted to fiat then paid to the worker via PayPal.
    * Only translators were allowed the use of PayPal. If a translator wanted to do any other form of task they were required to use crypto. They cannot do social media tasks or any other task by using PayPal.
    * There are fewer and fewer translators remaining on the PayPal system. It will be fully phased out.
  * There is continued growth on the network.
    * There are more videos in the works for KH
    * There is a lot of work going into the new work from Chicago office of KH. There is new glossary / terminology that needs to be put into the documents. This needs to be done for 13 different languages.
      * Why is there not more public awareness of this?
        * Much of KH is trade secret and cannot be revealed.
        * Could there be some kind of metric revealed about it? Such as how many documents are translated each month?
    * There are other tasks not related to translations in the works.
* Is there a way to create an automated app to allow clients to purchase in Fiat, but with an automated translation into EFX?
* The new app should integrate a wallet.
  * The first however many tasks will go back to which ever currency you chose. For EOS it is currently higher than BSC.
  * **ADOPTION is crucial – MUST be non-crypto friendly and automated!**
* Token Map vs. Flow Chart
  * Community developers (with Jesse and Laurens?) may be able to create a flow chart for the tokens to allow for a more comprehensive understanding of how tokens are distributed.
  * The community are capable of holding the token price down. When they don’t understand something. There is too much grey, and this needs to be clearly laid out, black and white.
* There are many ideas out there for dApps to be built upon Effect Network.
  * Waiting on a complete SDK

**Tasks**:

1. Dashboard updates:
