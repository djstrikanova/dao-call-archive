**QUESTIONS/DISCUSSIONS FOR/WITH TEAM:** (DAO related, not AMA)

* Classifying proposals: (proposal tracker)
  * When setting up the GitBook, \[DJSTRIKANOVA] looked for patterns in the DAO endorsing and the Foundation agreeing to act on it or not
    * Sometimes the Foundation will say that’s cool, but not a priority for our time, such as the dashboard calculator. The DAO community developers can take these on, completed them, then the tracker can record these as complete.
    * Sometimes the Foundation will get on board and commit to completing the tasks, such as P22 and the Hack-a-Thon, the proposal tracker will not mark as complete until after the Foundation has completed that task.
  * A proposal can be anything, but as we see more and more proposals, we will see the variety of categories emerging for classification.
  * When there are proposals that pass that the foundation will do, or could do, even small tech tasks, they should be kept to the forefront, kept attention on until those tasks are complete.
  * The Foundation do not necessarily need to be responsible for completing tasks.
  * There could be a rating system developed where people can vote on the outcome of the proposal upon completion to give the proposer a rating for reputation.
  * There is much to still work out.

**(I apologize for the following bolded text lacking content. My audio was badly cutting in and out. If anyone on the meeting can help fill in the blanks, please let me know and I will update.)**

* **How does liquidity pools affect the supply of EFX? (I lost audio, so no answer)**
* **(I lost audio, so no question)**
  * **We are not printing funds to pay workers, and we are not using reserves.**
  * **We have funds come in from a client, then we put that into the EFX token, then that’s there to pay the workers.**
  * **There is one riddle still to figure out and that’s the fluctuating price of EFX.**

**Missed conversation leading up to an invitation to join an in house live stream.**

**Pancake Swap marketing will be deferred until we have this discussion with Mikel.**

* **What happened to the big market launch for BSC and Pancake Swap?**
  * **There are a few other notable reasons for not launching like crazy.**
    * **The markets are ridiculous, and a lot of our Chinese influencers are now offline due to the Chinese government crack-down on crypto. If we can get them back online, then we can do stuff.**
    * **There is expenditures in accessing influencers and we shouldn’t waste funds by using these funds at the wrong time. So, we really want to get something that is robust and will execute a game plan. This is an area where Mikel will advise on.**
* We really need to have some kind of Medium article or other written output describing each of the Foundation, Effect.AI BV, and Effect DAO. Their roles, responsibilities and connections to each other.
  * There is confusion in the community because they are unclear of what each means, this can lead to misinformation and people getting unnecessarily upset.
  * Every project managing tokens has a foundation for this role.
    * Foundation:
      * There is the article of association for the Foundation
      * Foundation ran the token sale
      * Manages the funds
      * Based in Curacao and has a governing body and a trust that is employed, and there is an article of association. It is a non-profit organization, it is allowed to earn income to pay their bills and advance their vision, but not to make a profit.
      * There is a board of directors that helps to steer any decisions made. There are members of the core Effect.AI BV team that are on the board, but there are outside members as well that are there in Curacao.
        * The board is there to approve things, look at things, in relation to the articles of associations, the constitution, of what we have set out to build and make sure that any proposal is in line with that.
      * The foundation manages the funds to build out Effect Network.
      * This Foundation is specific to the White Paper of Effect Network. It is not there for any other purpose.
      * Other companies and developers wishing to build upon TEN that are outside the scope of Effect DAO, such as building a complete ecosystem on top of Effect Network, could apply to the Foundation for funds.
        * Can put forth an unsolicited/cold call to request support from the Foundation.
      * The Foundation ideally will deal with a multitude of businesses running atop of Effect Network.
    * Effect.AI BV:
      * The operational developing company, name has not changed with rebranding this remains Effect.AI BV.
      * This is the company that has been set in place to develop the Effect Network on behalf of the Foundation, on behalf of the vision of the Foundation.
      * The Foundation contracts Effect.AI BV to build out, develop and improve the Effect Network, in much the same way that the Ethereum Foundation gives money and grants to the Ethereum Alliance. Effect.AI BV is akin to Ethereum Alliance as such:
        * The Ethereum Alliance is based in Toronto, Canada, and they build out the business relationships and business partnerships, and have and agreement with their Foundation that they can profit off the IP of Ethereum for clients and consulting and these types of things. The Ethereum Alliance is a privately held company that has basically nothing to do other than it’s relationship to the Foundation. They communicate with each other, they write proposals and budgets, and the Foundation is there to keep them in line with the Foundation’s vision.
      * There could be an article written that shows the process on how to apply to the Foundation.
    * Effect DAO:
      * The DAO is employed by the Foundation
      * The DAO is ultimately about helping the Foundation increase use of Effect Network.
*
  * This can be done. “Jesse” will get on it.
* The roadmap has mention of a liquidity competition to be announced at the time of opening the LP on Pancake Swap. Are there any details on this that can be shared?
  * This is being worked on.
* Has there been any planning yet on what the Hack-a-thon might look like?
  * The Hack-a-thon is very inspirational and we need to be focusing on this topic to make it a success.
  * It is important to get some really good attention- build a great foundation of the whole thing.
  * Let’s not rush this event, but make it an event to be remembered.
    * Get all the ducks in a row – namely a strong SDK, but also other elements required to put on a strong event.
  * Is the Hack-a-thon a DAO event or an Effect.AI BV event, or both?
    * Should or could the planning and advertising come from within the DAO?
    * There could be proposals to help support this event.
      * The DAO community could begin developing ideas for how this event might manifest and how marketing for this event could unfold.
  * Some topics for the DAO to consider are:
    * Integrations into making the DAO better
    * Ways to create sustainability for the DAO
      * Currently it is not sustainable long term
  * Proposals could be made for people to:
    * Create promotional materials, etc.
    * Take classes to learner how to do something that will help move the DAO forward or otherwise benefit the DAO.
  * SDK is one giant part of the Hack-a-thon, but this is not the only part of the Hack-a-thon. This is a DAO event, that the Foundation is on board with and helping with. This is not simply a TEAM event. The DAO needs to active participants in the planning, marketing, and execution of this event.
    * Marketing and creating attention is even more important to get people in the door
    * Communications is important
    * Structuring the event is important.
  * An important part of this process may be to create a small-scaled informal hack-a-thon event to help provide structure for a larger event.
    * Perhaps a small event could be planned for the end of a year.
    * Perhaps a pre-event with about 3-4 teams, get the university involved, and some friends, and try to structure with the organization we’d want to see in place.
      * Then what is learned from that event can be used to structure a greater event where we have marketing and really push for a larger event.
* Progress update on SDK
  * Jesse was in attendance by listening, but was not able to verbally respond to questions. Will continue to keep requesting updates as this moves forward.
  * Can we get a link or links to where the updates for the SDK are being created?
* If you wanted to get starting to get building on TEN immediately, can this be done directly. Can we interact with the smart contract directly yourself? (query, edit, send requests, send transactions, etc.)
  * The interface is already ready for this now. The interface has been ready for a couple of years already.
  * The team sets up tasks in the same way anyone else would set up tasks.
    * If this isn’t accessible to community developers then this needs to be accessed asap.
  * Once this is set up, the team still needs to be called to activate it.
    * The goal is to have this fully automated so that the team does not need to be contacted to activate it.
* How is the progress of migrating Effect Force over to BSC?
  * Effect Force workers will be able to chose where they will get paid to.
  * The bridge is done.
  * There is more tech needed to be implemented to enable the dual payout options.
    * If people chose to work for EOS they will be paid in real time
    * If people chose to work for BSC, then workers are paid to their account and will then click on a claim option to have their payout
  * Jesse will need to update what stage the tech is at.
* The SDK is the fulfillment of Proposal 16: Expanding Documentation: Librarians of the Galaxy [http://dao.effect.network/proposals/16](http://dao.effect.network/proposals/16)
* Discuss the potential for proposal #3 Effect Design [https://dao.effect.network/proposals/3](https://dao.effect.network/proposals/3)
  * This is requesting something be built, and there needs to be a plan for building it out. They are requesting a dApp, but needs to have developers to build it out before futhering this.
* Telegram Main Chat has been revamped to take control back from the negative talk.
  * The main tg channel is linked to all official Effect Network websites, this is a business channel, a landing page before moving into other channels. This page needs to be clean for businesses, new clients, new members joining so that it is clean and professional for them.
  * The TA channel will not be moderated strictly. This is an area where members can be more open and vocal with their opinions this can be used.
  * Rochelle activated a moderation bot to manage and set firm guidelines. While this might be counter intuitive and is definitely a more centralized approach, this is clearly needed at this time.
* Organize an AMA ‘interview’ event with the team
  * Chris says, “Just name it, any time.”
    * There are questions that simply can’t be answered legally.
    * Some questions seem like they are simple, but are not.
    * Advice to KISS
  * Is open to having a meeting in the format of our choice
    * We would like preplanned questions
    * With considered thought to the answers and time for reflection to see if there can be further prompting.
    * To have a topical dialogue to futher explain the information given.
  * The point of this ‘event’ is resolve some of the conflict due to misunderstanding and missed information in the community. To begin fostering a positive and productive TG community.
  * It is important to have these AMAs and other questions answers type sessions recorded in writing, transcribed, for future reference or future promotion.

**OPEN DISCUSSION:**

* The EFX dashboard, the counters underneath the separate proposals have different units of measurement. This is a psychological thing, but if you see 2M, which stands for millions, compared to 210K, the psychologics say that the 210K is valued more than the 2M. It would be nice to have one unit of measurement. For example: let’s say 1000 represented by a K, make 2000 against 200K.
  * There may be different views for other people.
  * Add a GitHub ticket to have the proposal overview cleaned up
* The DAO calls could be used to help prioritize proposals. To discuss which proposals need more immediate attention than others.
* How to become an effective DAO guardian? A guide created for this would be valuable.
  * Get into the DAO
  * What it means to be a DAO member
  * Get active in Discord
  * How to vote
  * How to vote properly
  * How to get your fees, etc
    * Bree will do this, A guide to participate in the DAO
    * Write up a proposal for it, with an ask
* Write an article, video, etc on the topic: What would I do with 1000 people from around the world at my disposal to help me start a business or be apart of my business?
  * What would you use 10000 workers? To provoke creative thinking.
  * Perhaps this could be incentivized.
  * If there are enough answers to this question, then perhaps we could give some EFX to the best ideas, or even follow through with helping them with mentors to help them start up.
  * In the worst case we may generate some ideas for the DAO to sponsor for themselves.
  * Could we the DAO create a marketing campaign to promote this?
  * This would be a way to get people thinking?
  * The Weekly Effect could be used for this.
  * This may produce some really great ideas
* The Weekly Effect videos take an entire day to produce.
  * There isn’t always big news every week.
  * This is an opportunity to use Weekly Effect for education and promoting Effect Network for new people when there isn’t big news to be announced.
* Suggestion to Chris and Rochelle to reach out to Mozillia for translation services.

**OLD DISCUSSIONS** (tabled)

* Discuss further with team about incorporating worker pay in perpetuity of trained algorithms.
* Discuss a system to subsidize or support resource fees for DAO members.

**Potential Proposals:**

* Using Effect Captions to update community made guide videos. Especially videos with lasting relevance. Could be used to promote Effect Captions.
  * Would need to include the quoted price points in the proposal
  * What languages would be prudent to put into the closed captions
    * English only would be about $20
* Roles of responsibility (with compensation)
  * Define role: Recording secretary
* Developer costs for dashboard improvements
  * The community developer group
  * There will likely be a proposal mapped out with multiple phases.
  * Before the proposal is put forth they need to decide how to arrange for taxes and other dynamics related to payments
  * Proposal for opensource the product
* Timeline
