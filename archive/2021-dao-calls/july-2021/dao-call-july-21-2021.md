**QUESTIONS/DISCUSSIONS FOR/WITH TEAM:**

* Is there any progress in finding a second Jehudah for the opposite hours of the day?
  * There have been discussions within the team regarding a second official community admin for Telegram, but as of yet there has been no decision regarding whom or under conditions.
  * This is in progress.
* Has Laurens had a chance yet to gather the swap statistics for sharing with the community?
  * Laurens has not yet done any work to create this, but this is on his list of things to do. He will likely get to this after the swap codes that have been issued have all been seen to have made their swaps.
* Has there been any decision regarding an election for the HG?
  * All are in agreement that this is necessary.
  * Mikel is taking on the task of figuring out the best way to go about doing this.
    * He will come up with a proposal plan to share with the community.
* What would be the best way to subsidize resources for DAO members for DAO related transactions?
  * The best way would be through wallets such as fuel through Anchor or by taking advantage the EOS community eospowerup.io.
* Is there API available on GitHub for team created swap tools and other interface tools?
  * Will this come out with the SDK?
  * Will the SDK include opens source code for Effect Translate?
* Is there any progress in regard to updating CMC, CoinGecko, etc? (Is this a Chris question?)
* Currently, to fully exit/unsubscribe from Effect Force an email needs to be sent to the team.
  * In the Terms and Conditions link found in the profile section of Effect Force the process for leaving Effect Force can be found.
  * Discussions around creating an easily accessible click on link to leave the Force, as there is in the DAO to leave the DAO, resulted in varying opinions on whether this option should be there or whether it was not necessary as there are already clear instructions on how to go about leaving the Force should someone wish to.
    * Every work platform strategies are simply to not use them anymore.
    * Once you are working on a platform you are working for the requester not for the platform.
    * What is on the recorded on the blockchain will remain on the blockchain, to remove your email attached to an account an email is required as is stated in the terms and services.
      * There has only been a few emails requesting to leave the platform so this has not been on the radar.
    * To add a button to leave the platform wouldn’t remove data recorded on the blockchain.
    * Technically a new account system would be better than adding a button.
      * The new account system updates coming will improve this system and it should be really easy to remove your email.
  * Something to note is that, so far as legal ties to Effect.AI, you are only tied to them when doing tasks for them. The Effect Force platform itself is not tied to Effect.AI. The upcoming updates will make it more definitively decentralized.
* Also, for Effect DAO, should we be considering a minimum hold of tokens in order to stay registered in Effect DAO.
  * It costs 500EFX to join the DAO. Should there be a minimum hold of 500EFX to remain an active and registered DAO member?
    * In this way, should someone fully withdrawal all their funds and just walk away without manually leaving the DAO, then perhaps after a set amount of cycles or after one full cycle if there is no activity, and zero tokens registered then they are automatically cleaned out and deregistered.
  * Discussions were mixed on this with the consensus being to leave as is.
    * If someone needed to pull everything out for a reason, but didn’t really want to leave, they’d lose all their stake age as it is when they are able to become active again.
    * There are people registered as members who have completely left, pulled everything and have been inactive for several cycles. Perhaps there could be an amount of inactive cycles before deregistering that account.
    * If someone was inactive for any given length of time, and became active, if there account remained their vote history would remain in tact.
    * Also, if you leave the DAO do you get the EFX returned to you when you leave? Is this in escrow.
  * However, it is something that would need to go through a proposal.
  * A good filter system may be useful to organizing inactive members.
    * The filter could be a simple table.

**LIQUIDITY INCENTIVIZATION/VOLUME:**

* Vigor:
  * Community member Lennie is really involved in Vigor and will look into what needs to happen with EFX for it to be listed with Vigor.
    * I have not yet heard back from Lennie.

**HACK-A-THON:**

* Updates:
  * The Foundation will be able to cover three months of the Devpost subscription.
  * The current thinking is to structure two hackathons (the first a practice or small scale run, the second a larger event) in that period where there will be:
    * 2 weeks for registration
    * 2 weeks for coding/programming
    * 2 weeks for evaluation
  * The practice run would allow people to become familiar with Devpost and the process
    * This would teach us about any hiccups and give us opportunity to make improvements.
    * This would allow people to get familiar with the SDK. There would be no expectation to come up with fully formed products out of the first hackathon.
  * The second would include advertising and try to bring in lots of people.
  * We would like to include developers from China.
    * We need to be aware of when the major holidays are to avoid these times.
* Question for Chris:
  * Chris announced a prize pool of 50k for the SDK, but did not specify if this was dollars or EFX.
    * Jesse felt it was too soon to discuss prize pools for the Hack-a-Thon
* Considerations for having a yearly hackathon will likely depend upon the result of the first rounds of hackathons.

**OPEN DISCUSSION:**

* It would be really nice to have more feedback on proposals.
  * There is Discord, but people are not using it.
    * Putting a comment section with the vote is convenient and would be a quick way for people to state their reasoning behind their vote, but it would be permanently recorded on the blockchain, there would be no edits.
  * The results of the calculator vote indicate there should be more feedback for the reasoning behind they way people voted.
    * There were people willing to pay the full ask amount on P51 (calculator), but these same people are not willing to pay the full ask amount when the same ask is broken down into scaled options. This is somewhat perplexing as people were prepared to payout the original ask.
    * Also the original proposer of the calculator P30 voted abstain for P51 and voted no for all proposals P52-63, yet there has been no discernable feedback left from the original proposer regarding what was liked or not liked, or why they were not willing to support payment for the creation of the calculator.
      * One possibility is that the original proposer expected the team to create the tool for no additional payment, but this is only guessing.
* P2, the DAO merch store.
  * Rochelle is considering some revisions to this to create it as a dApp and perhaps use the Hackathon to push the development of it.
  * This would expand what could be sold to be more than just Effect Network merchandise.
    * She is looking to include Fair Trade goods that would be in line with Effect Network’s social good
    * This would be merged into tech goods.
      * For example their designs could be created into laptop covers, etc.
    * There would be integration into Effect Force.
  * There is much to work on for this.
  * This will depend upon what the SDK lets happen. (SDK will be released in phases)
  * What is the potential in getting the Foundation to help fund this dApp?
  * Having the DAO support this dApp would require multiple proposal cycles.
    * But then all profits would go to the DAO and the DAO would have it’s own business.
    * If the DAO will not support the dApp, then it will be a private business.

**OLD DISCUSSIONS** (tabled)

* Alternating times for DAO Calls to allow for greater participation.
  * Proposal in place.
* Discuss further with team about incorporating worker pay in perpetuity of trained algorithms.
* Reporting of sub-groups to the weekly calls.
  * Suggestions:
    * Define exactly what the HG’s role is,
      * this should be visible on the blockchain and on the dashboard, in the smart contract
    * Elect new members
    * Make use of GitBook
* Has there been any updates to this that can be shared?

**Potential Proposals:**

* How to become a guardian guide
* Using Effect Captions to update community made guide videos. Especially videos with lasting relevance. Could be used to promote Effect Captions.
  * Would need to include the quoted price points in the proposal
  * What languages would be prudent to put into the closed captions
    * English only would be about $20
* Developer costs for dashboard improvements
  * The community developer group
  * There will likely be a proposal mapped out with multiple phases.
  * Before the proposal is put forth they need to decide how to arrange for taxes and other dynamics related to payments
  * Proposal for opensource the product
* Timeline
* Proposals to the Foundation:
  * DAO Store start-up expenses
  * Hack-a-thon expenses
