* The .pdf was really small to see. Not sure everyone noticed it, at least at first. Some complaints or concerns were about not enough details for the ask amount and then asking where is …. But the answers were on the .pdf.
  * The file attachment could be made in a larger font, so that it is more noticeable.

* It’s been a serious struggle in October to get the notes done, too much else going on in the everyday world. There won’t be an invoice for October.
* Hoping to set up transcriptions before long of the audio recordings to be done by the Force. Will get them all caught up when this can be done.
  * Cost of this is yet to be determined.
  * This would provide regular weekly tasks for qualified workers.
    * AMAs could also be transcribed through this set up.
    * If cost is reasonable, perhaps AMAs (or other important videos or meetings) could be transcribed into different languages.

**QUESTIONS/DISCUSSIONS FOR/WITH TEAM:**

* SDK:
  * Has the first release of the SDK been made public yet?
* Updates to the official website?
  * Are there any planned?
  * Is the team open to suggestions?

Other?

**LIQUIDITY INCENTIVIZATION/VOLUME:**

* Thoughts about the active farm? Going well?

**HACK-A-THON:**

* Updates and discussion on the hackathon.

**HIGH GUARD:**

**OPEN DISCUSSION:**

* Mascot competition
  * This idea is on pause to consider a more open framework for submissions.
* How to best support new community members who have trouble grasping this project?

(Or, how to help those who can’t help themselves?)

* Will create a page on GitBook that will be a “would you like to help with… “ type of page. Listing some menial tasks that people could just pick up to complete and to and then put into a proposal for cost of time and energy.

Other?
