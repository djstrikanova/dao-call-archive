* It’s been a struggle in October to get the notes done, if they are not done in time, I might not charge for them, as it could be a while before they do get done. A bit tough to juggle new time demands.

**QUESTIONS/DISCUSSIONS FOR/WITH TEAM:**

* SDK:
  * A set of 3 Medium posts are planned, the first has been released, this will provide updates for both the SDK and progress on the Effect Force update.
    * The first of these posts is found here: [https://medium.com/effect-ai/tech-blog-effect-account-system-a3bd8dfe93d4](https://medium.com/effect-ai/tech-blog-effect-account-system-a3bd8dfe93d4)
    * Second tech blog: [https://medium.com/effect-ai/tech-blog-on-chain-microtasks-6e8bb82c8e1d](https://medium.com/effect-ai/tech-blog-on-chain-microtasks-6e8bb82c8e1d)
  * SDK is being worked on in TestNet
    * Early stage ready, it has shape,
    * It could be open source by this weekend, and published in some form.
* Has there been any more updates to the DAO Dashboard in the last week?
* Orion Protocol should be added to the website and Bidesk removed.
* A marketing push to knew community members is now obvious. TG is more active. There has been some great enthusiasm, and the cynical commentary has all but disappeared. Having Jesse and Rochelle pop in on occasion is helping. An admin from the American time zones will be more crucial with increased participants. Any word on finding someone?
  * Jesse does not have this information
* Could we have our own DEX swap on the DAO Dashboard for EFX and NFX and move the pool from Defibox over, or continue it and have two?
  * Perhaps a link direct to Defibox
  * Perhaps an embedded swap tool from Defibox could be added
* /bot Q\&A for TG
  * Rochelle is building up /command options
  * Send her any / responses you think are necessary and she will edit and create a command for it if appropriate.

**LIQUIDITY INCENTIVIZATION/VOLUME:**

* There is an increased interest in the LP farm
* With sufficient value posting in CMC should be possible

**HACK-A-THON:**

* Aiming to do a smaller sized hackathon in November
* With a larger sized hackathon in January
* New proposal 79, has now been posted, there is a pdf document of the general layout of what the hackathon could look like
  * Using Devpost platform
  * Created a small schedule
  * Offer for people to help participate in organization
  * There will be 4 sessions
  * There are some F\&Q
* Last week of November is tentative start date
* Proposal an appeal for DAO treasury to be used for the prize
  * USDC and EFX combined prize (DAO and Foundation)
  * 3 cycles should be enough to collect the funds for the prize pool
* The Hackathon can be done on the testnet

**HIGH GUARD:**

**OPEN DISCUSSION:**

* Mascot competition
  * Idea to use Effect Force as a submission platform with an EFX amount of payment for submitting
    * Doing a battle – like was done with the NFTs
      * How many NFTs were used in the battle
      * What was the cost for that battle?
    * Start with determinig
  * Top three go to a vote in DAO proposals, using Y, A, N as selection votes
    * Or more
  * Should we do some marketing through Twitter?
  * How much should the prize be?
    * Should there be different prizes for 1st, 2nd, 3rd?
* Mascot vision
  * Purpose and intent statement
  * What criteria would we like?
    * Do we want to restrict to a more business – like mascot, or a more cute mascot, or leave it open?
    * What guidelines would we like for people to follow?
      * Original work
      * Concept drawing only, polished work only, or any degree of finish?

Other?

**OLD DISCUSSIONS** (tabled)

* GitBook

!! Bree remains appreciative for someone to be willing to help out with creating some of these point-form guides.

*
  * The community centre page has been updated into tables. [https://effect-dao-docs.gitbook.io/effectdaocc/](https://effect-dao-docs.gitbook.io/effectdaocc/)
    * There are step-by-step guides needed.
      * How to become a DAO Guardian/Member
      * How to join the DAO Discord
      * How to participate in DAO discussions
      * How to access the DAO call recordings
      * How to understand EP, Stake Age, NFX
      * Why Stake in the DAO vs. Why Stake in the Farm or contribute liquidity to PCS or Orion Protocol
      * Other?
  * Rod E suggests making little videos to visually support these guides.
    * He may be open to helping out in creating the videos if the text is pre-written.
* Is it better to build one or two liquidity pairs on one platform PCS, or to diversify platforms?
  *
    * Some more thought on this may be warranted.
    * We want to attract as many people to EFX as possible, without sacrificing too much spread and not getting anywhere.
* Discuss further with team about incorporating worker pay in perpetuity of trained algorithms.

**Potential Proposals:**

* ~~Renew the MasterChef~~
* Create a proposal to have a competition for a memeable mascot
* Confidence vote in current HG membership, with conditions set to allow for removals and additions
* Giving the HG general Treasurer responsibilities
* ~~Funds for the MasterChef contract over the next few cycles.~~
* How to become a guardian guide
* Using Effect Captions to update community made guide videos. Especially videos with lasting relevance. Could be used to promote Effect Captions.
  * Would need to include the quoted price points in the proposal
  * What languages would be prudent to put into the closed captions
    * English only would be about $20
* Timeline
* Proposals to the Foundation:
  * DAO created NFTs
  * ~~Hack-a-thon expenses~~
