# October 6, 2021

They are kind of uncertain exactly what… chatter

Bree cannot join today ..she said

Agenda : Proposals UP

(female voice )Proposal 76 That is her typical invoice.

That will be going and we will process.

Proposal 73 : It looks like mine for the recording was accepted. Task creation funded by new staff funds more has passed and people are interested in exploring that

Proposal 75 : Also passed The continuation of the EFX pancake swap ..Excitement !

One proposal is pending. Rod joined the meeting

Questions from Rod for Rachel : Since you are very familiar with what STK can do

How feasible are doing those web screening type tasks. For example you assign a worker to look at a web screen and find very specific information and plug it in and complete the task. How feasible are those types of tasks? Rachel : They are very very feasible. Good !

Rod: I have another question the STK and the template stuff:

If the STK is not published yet is there something available if they want to try something out?

Rachel : Sort of : It’s half in process right now. Right now, I would have to do the templates now and add instructions right now , so that they can add their get it set up and get it to where they can add there tasks to it. And then it goes live and they can publish as they want. But right now I would have to do the template and set up everything and the basics

Rod : So it’s something you have to do

Rachel : Yes so if the neuro Pepe people did it now they would be able to control part of it but not all of it because we are half way moved over with the STK

Rod : So then if I wanted to bring onboard other start-ups-How much,

Because I know you helped the Neuro-pepe people out, will that be a standard and if you have more time would you help out start-ups get a handle of things or will there be a cost there.

Rachel : Yes I will help start-ups get into it until they get the STK started and launched and then they can manage on their own in the meantime. That is part of my job assisting.

Rod : So then you are fine if I relay them to you to discuss what is possible.

Rachel : Because the big things that they need on their end is just a EFX Account or I don’t know if we would do it. I forgot how Jessie did it for the them. They would need to have some EFX available to add for their tax and then make up a worker account. But then I would need their instructions and what they wanted to do and what kind of things and then I could put it into a design and show them. Screen shots and stuff. And they would be able to validate and download the results on their own and upload on their own. It’s just that creating that template I would have to do

Rod : Okay they have to have their own EFX account. So one potential thing and this is something – the proposal we just passed that AC was talking about before is if we wanted to subsidies tasks on the work force- can that also mean that we subsitizing tasks for start-ups. That would help them to get the ball rolling

Rachel : And then they would not have to invest too much to try it.

Rod : That makes it possible b/c when I am talking w/ a few of my friends and they had a good idea for a solid use ( I can’t be more specific as they asked me not to but) They had a foundation URL and ready to build it even though I am being ambiguous on what it is specifically but I will relay that to them.

Rachel : They can approach me with their ideas and I will be completely confidential. I promise, should they want to delve into it.

Rod : How do we determine the amount of EFX or the costs of tasks?

Rachel : A lot of that goes into task set up. How many steps does the worker take to get it set up and that kind of factors in. If I had a task that had to do 50 things it would pay more than a task where you had to do 2 things. A lot in planning and task design.

Rod : what about tasks that had the same number of things? For example when they go to the website we don’t know how many of the things they are going to find. It could be low or high. Would it then average out?

Rachel : It depends on how you do it. I helped a requester once and they had a huge speadsheet of links of links to online stores and they wanted to know what payments the stores accepted : visa or mastercard, paypal, discover, amax. So initially they put the task on INTERK and they paid .25 cents per task. The task was one link to a store and you had to check the boxes of what payment methods they used, but a lot of times those store links in their spreadsheet the shops were not even open anymore. So this person was wasted .25 cents U.S. every time the store was not open. So I worked with this requestor and said ‘why don’t you do a task where it’s maybe one or two cents per link’ and then it’s just is this website valid or not? And then I said run it 3 tasks per link and then you’ve got three different workers working on that one link task. And then you take the consensus the two out of three agree and then that’s the answer. All the yes ones are the good valid ones to pay the extra money for to get all the different payments. So it depends on : you have to think of all the variables that the worker can run into and then try to mitigate those the best. That makes sense.

Rod : They are able to determine how many validators per task quite easily.

Rachel : Right now the NFT sorting tasks, sometimes it’s, two workers or three workers per images. The requestor can pick or than can just have one to one.

Rod : That’s awesome.

Rachel: So by doing it in a consensus out of three you are getting your validation done. Instead of running a separate check. This person is in the field running the results and seeing other things. Task creation is an art.

Rod : Sounds like it yah.

Rachel: There are all kinds of variable. And too you have to curate a workforce. There are all kind of people that you give a qualification task and have the qualifications for it. You want to limit how many they do a day. Do you want to watch for how quickly they do them. There are build in validation things and then things that you can do on your own to make it the best.

Rod : Do we have access to the stats or the qualifications of what these people are able to do. But will the Doa eventually have the stats on the work that the person is capable of?

Rachel: Once the STK is published anyone can make their own requestor accounts and they’ll make their own tasks and in there you will be able to see the set qualifiers : with EFFECT force , English image labelling , instance detection and you will have those qualifiers to choose from. Then you can create your own.

Rod: Super neat.

Rachel: There is a lot. I am basically making sure that every feature that is on all the other micro -tasking platforms are in ours. And catered toward requestors and workers, because that side is missing in a lot of platforms.

Rod: Right on. What you have is limitless

Rachel : I’m excited. Then to have it happen on the block chain and using and executing a smart contract. That is really cool and tying all of it in. They are working very hard on it. Moriss jessy

Rod : Is it going to be anyone else putting up these tasks. Are you the only one who knows about these tasks.

Rachel : The STK tasks will have guides, instructions and helpful tips. So I expect to see a requestor area where people ask questions and I give them help as well.

Rod : I can see that happening to.

Rachel : There is going to be a lot of documentation and I am looking forward to workers reading the STK documentations about the tasks and documentation. So the workers can see what goes into this. We need this on the block chain.

Rod : The start-ups mention that coming in an subsidizing the work would really help them out and motivate them to use the platform for what their building and I hope we get some good case examples to.

Rachel : If they make a custom task template on MTurk then they can use that right on the force. It is quite similar.

Rod: Can you explain what you mean by the template.

Rachel : Have you ever done a listing on Ebay. It is something like that. You can use your HTML code or explain what you get.

Rod : That gives me a better idea yes.

Rachel : I can put it up this way and it’s not going to sell very well, unless I do these things to improve or lay out the instructions this way so that I will get what I need. So on MTurk the staff has to have the AWS account and their access tokens loaded and it’s going to be easier for our requestors to use our platform than MTurk. And MTurk charges you to use their qualifications. The usefulness of Effect Force is that you are not paying extra to have workers who have passed the English qualification, or the image qualifications.

Rod : I can’t wait to see it come along.

Rachel : I can’t either but I can wait because I am also helping with it.

Is it still on schedule.

Rachel : I have seen the boards but I have not had a chance to talk to Jessie in the last two weeks. There will be some more information on the next blog post we are creating that shows how the Doa fits in with the moderations and the Effect Force. That’s in the works and will be published within a week. Then Bree will use that for her planning.

I am reading …Looks like ’Announcements and Discussions’ Is there anything else on the agenda.

We are trying to build an some guides on the agenda and step by step guides and help to write these out on the book.

Examples : How to become a Doa Gardian Member. How to join the Doa? How to participate in Doa Discussions and access the Doa call recordings. What if there is a mobile issue and some people cannot access it. Someone was confused by a Nitro pop-up ad. The calls are still in there and I have looked on mobile and it lets them in. I will go over the permissions and the calls. Bree had some issue to when we first started the Doa, but we thought the issue might be with the computer. I will keep working on that and the bot needs to get rid of the level thing because that is not applicable any more. And areas that we need better instructions for.

Rod : Let’s try to create a new account and see if that’s an issue at all.

Rachel : New people need to access the calls. Hopefully it wasn’t ‘user error’ and we will use a tester account.

Rod : Aside from that with the liquidity bonus it seems like as long as we. Counting the vote and abstentions then we have 95% of the vote Yes

Rachel : I really love the comment feature.

Rod : Yes that will be useful when we get to the more controversial proposals where the opinion is split. That covers everything and my questions. Do you want to break from here.

Rachel : There is much to do.

See you all next week.
