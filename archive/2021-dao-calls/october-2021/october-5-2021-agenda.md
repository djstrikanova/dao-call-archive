**PROPOSALS:**

DAO Call Recorder for September 2021 [https://dao.effect.network/proposals/76](https://dao.effect.network/proposals/76) Status: Pending (will be posted today, if not already)

Weekly DAO Call Recordings [https://dao.effect.network/proposals/73](https://dao.effect.network/proposals/73) Status: Processing, passed

Task creation funded by unused DAO funds [https://dao.effect.network/proposals/74](https://dao.effect.network/proposals/74) Status: Processing, Passed

* This proposal strongly indicates that members are in favour of providing funds to support workers tasks.
* There is disagreement from the previous meeting that it would be the team that decides which tasks. It is agreed that tasks should be provided by the DAO and not by the team.
* This requires more discussions around supporting the location of where the funds would go and how those funds would be controlled.
* Further discussion on what type of tasks might be valuable to the DAO currently.
* There is an assumption that no task would be created until after the SDK is released.
* Perhaps a committee needs to be created for this purpose?

Continuation of the EFX Pancake Swap LP Reward Farm [https://dao.effect.network/proposals/75](https://dao.effect.network/proposals/75) Status: Processing, Passed 3.2M/147K Y/N

* Is this enough of a pass to move forward with the new farm?
* If a go, what would marketing for the new farm look like?
* Should the team be solely responsible for marketing the new farm or should this be a joint effort between the team and the DAO?

**QUESTIONS/DISCUSSIONS FOR/WITH TEAM:**

* SDK:
  * A set of 3 Medium posts are planned, the first has been released, this will provide updates for both the SDK and progress on the Effect Force update.
    * The first of these posts is found here: [https://medium.com/effect-ai/tech-blog-effect-account-system-a3bd8dfe93d4](https://medium.com/effect-ai/tech-blog-effect-account-system-a3bd8dfe93d4)
    * Second tech blog: [https://medium.com/effect-ai/tech-blog-on-chain-microtasks-6e8bb82c8e1d](https://medium.com/effect-ai/tech-blog-on-chain-microtasks-6e8bb82c8e1d)
* Has there been any more updates to the DAO Dashboard in the last week?

**LIQUIDITY INCENTIVIZATION/VOLUME:**

* discussion on P75

**HACK-A-THON:**

* Any updates?

**HIGH GUARD:**

**OPEN DISCUSSION:**

* Bree will have the mascot proposal ready for the next cycle in two weeks.
  * Any suggestions for a prize amount would be helpful.
  * The little robot concept is done, a humanoid android type figure is being worked on. These will be provided as samples and set as a challenge to others to improve or come up with better concepts.
  * Concept art will be the end goal – so quality of finished product will not be the focus.
* GitBook

!! Bree remains appreciative for someone to be willing to help out with creating some of these point-form guides.

*
  * The community centre page has been updated into tables. [https://effect-dao-docs.gitbook.io/effectdaocc/](https://effect-dao-docs.gitbook.io/effectdaocc/)
    * There are step-by-step guides needed.
      * How to become a DAO Guardian/Member
      * How to join the DAO Discord
      * How to participate in DAO discussions
      * How to access the DAO call recordings
      * How to understand EP, Stake Age, NFX
      * Why Stake in the DAO vs. Why Stake in the Farm or contribute liquidity to PCS or Orion Protocol
      * Other?
  * Rod E suggests making little videos to visually support these guides.
    * He may be open to helping out in creating the videos if the text is pre-written.

**Other?**

**OLD DISCUSSIONS** (tabled)

* Is it better to build one or two liquidity pairs on one platform PCS, or to diversify platforms?
  *
    * Some more thought on this may be warranted.
    * We want to attract as many people to EFX as possible, without sacrificing too much spread and not getting anywhere.
* Discuss further with team about incorporating worker pay in perpetuity of trained algorithms.

**Potential Proposals:**

* ~~Renew the MasterChef~~
* Create a proposal to have a competition for a memeable mascot
* Confidence vote in current HG membership, with conditions set to allow for removals and additions
* Giving the HG general Treasurer responsibilities
* ~~Funds for the MasterChef contract over the next few cycles.~~
* How to become a guardian guide
* Using Effect Captions to update community made guide videos. Especially videos with lasting relevance. Could be used to promote Effect Captions.
  * Would need to include the quoted price points in the proposal
  * What languages would be prudent to put into the closed captions
    * English only would be about $20
* Timeline
* Proposals to the Foundation:
  * DAO created NFTs
  * ~~Hack-a-thon expenses~~
