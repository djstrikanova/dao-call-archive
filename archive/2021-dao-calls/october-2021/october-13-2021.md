**QUESTIONS/DISCUSSIONS FOR/WITH TEAM:**

* SDK:
  * A set of 3 Medium posts are planned, the first has been released, this will provide updates for both the SDK and progress on the Effect Force update.
    * The first of these posts is found here: [https://medium.com/effect-ai/tech-blog-effect-account-system-a3bd8dfe93d4](https://medium.com/effect-ai/tech-blog-effect-account-system-a3bd8dfe93d4)
    * Second tech blog: [https://medium.com/effect-ai/tech-blog-on-chain-microtasks-6e8bb82c8e1d](https://medium.com/effect-ai/tech-blog-on-chain-microtasks-6e8bb82c8e1d)
* Has there been any more updates to the DAO Dashboard in the last week?
* TG is a bit more active lately. There has been some great enthusiasm, mixed with cynicism. Having the team pop in on occasion is helping. Still, a north American admin would be beneficial. Any word on finding someone?

**LIQUIDITY INCENTIVIZATION/VOLUME:**

* Is there an exact date on when the new MC will be active?
* Is there a marketing plan in place to push the farm to improve the use of the farm?
  * Is there a marketing campaign that the DAO could initiate?
    * Should we try to create a marketing sub-committee?

**HACK-A-THON:**

* Any updates?

**HIGH GUARD:**

**OPEN DISCUSSION:**

* P74. Task creation: Intent of author: Lets find some ways to use DAO funds to get tasks up so that visitors to the platform can see a project with a real use case. First time I visited the platform back in 2019 there were tons of tasks. I went on to do tasks, bought more EFX, staked, earned NFX, joined DAO, added liquidity and farmed etc... None of that would of happened if I had found nothing on that first visit.
  * The SDK will be available soon. These tasks should be DAO initiatives. Let’s brainstorm.

**Other?**

**OLD DISCUSSIONS** (tabled)

* Bree will have the mascot proposal ready for the next cycle.
  * Any suggestions for a prize amount would be helpful.
  * The little robot concept is done, a humanoid android type figure is being worked on. These will be provided as samples and set as a challenge to others to improve or come up with better concepts.
  * Concept art will be the end goal – so quality of finished product will not be the focus.
* GitBook

!! Bree remains appreciative for someone to be willing to help out with creating some of these point-form guides.

*
  * The community centre page has been updated into tables. [https://effect-dao-docs.gitbook.io/effectdaocc/](https://effect-dao-docs.gitbook.io/effectdaocc/)
    * There are step-by-step guides needed.
      * How to become a DAO Guardian/Member
      * How to join the DAO Discord
      * How to participate in DAO discussions
      * How to access the DAO call recordings
      * How to understand EP, Stake Age, NFX
      * Why Stake in the DAO vs. Why Stake in the Farm or contribute liquidity to PCS or Orion Protocol
      * Other?
  * Rod E suggests making little videos to visually support these guides.
    * He may be open to helping out in creating the videos if the text is pre-written.
* Is it better to build one or two liquidity pairs on one platform PCS, or to diversify platforms?
  *
    * Some more thought on this may be warranted.
    * We want to attract as many people to EFX as possible, without sacrificing too much spread and not getting anywhere.
* Discuss further with team about incorporating worker pay in perpetuity of trained algorithms.

**Potential Proposals:**

* ~~Renew the MasterChef~~
* Create a proposal to have a competition for a memeable mascot
* Confidence vote in current HG membership, with conditions set to allow for removals and additions
* Giving the HG general Treasurer responsibilities
* ~~Funds for the MasterChef contract over the next few cycles.~~
* How to become a guardian guide
* Using Effect Captions to update community made guide videos. Especially videos with lasting relevance. Could be used to promote Effect Captions.
  * Would need to include the quoted price points in the proposal
  * What languages would be prudent to put into the closed captions
    * English only would be about $20
* Timeline
* Proposals to the Foundation:
  * DAO created NFTs
  * ~~Hack-a-thon expenses~~
