DEADLINE August 20th 12pm ET! Orion Protocol EFX-USDT URGET MESSAGE [https://dao.effect.network/proposals/71](https://dao.effect.network/proposals/71) Status: Closed, Accepted

**QUESTIONS/DISCUSSIONS FOR/WITH TEAM:**

* Communication from the team needs to ramp up.
  * The team are working really hard on what’s coming up and are aware that communication has been lacking and needs improvement
  * The Weekly Effect is being worked on and is delayed.
* SDK:
  * The next update will be Friday.
  * A set of 3 Medium posts are planned, the first has been released, this will provide updates for both the SDK and progress on the Effect Force update.
    * The first of these posts is found here: [https://medium.com/effect-ai/tech-blog-effect-account-system-a3bd8dfe93d4](https://medium.com/effect-ai/tech-blog-effect-account-system-a3bd8dfe93d4)
* There has been some good activity on GitHub with ticket updates to the DAO Dashboard getting completed.
  * Noman is an intern who is working his way through the GitHub tickets.
  * Comments will be able to be added with your vote.
  * Continue to add your requests for Dashboard updates to GitHub, as there is an intern assigned to these requests.
    * Make an account for GitHub and leave a ticket. Anyone can do this.
  * Reiterate adding vote weight to the dashboard history section.
  * Jesse is hoping there will be a steady release of feature updates to the dashboard.
* &#x20;The bridge is really slow moving from BSC to EOS. The delay can be quite significant. It is faster moving from EOS to BSC.
  * This could be a big concern as Effect Force starts picking up with BSC options.
  * Jesse is in contact with pTokens frequently and he will discuss this issue with them to find a solution.
  * Send Jesse a message every time your tokens get stuck in the bridge so that he can address this issue if it’s still happening.

**LIQUIDITY INCENTIVIZATION/VOLUME:**

* The end date for the farm is October 8th, 2021.
  * Foundation rewards for this MC have not yet been added, Jesse will ensure they are added before the currently applied rewards run out.
  * When will a proposal need to be posted to create a new MasterChef?
    * Jesse will speak with Mikel about a proposal for a new MC.
    * For consideration:
      * What size will we make the pool?
      * What will the duration be?
      * What can we do to make it more successful?
  * Because the migration tool in the MasterChef has been disabled to protect the LPs, when the MasterChef ends the LPs will be returned. Staking the LPs in the new MC will need to be done manually by the LP owner.
    * There could be a single button that users to click on to have the migration happen.
  * Some improvements need to be made on a new one.
    * A longer duration may be more enticing as people will have more time to gain rewards.
  * Benefits to EFX is that they guarantee you some liquidity for greater stability in price.
    * Projects with a massive liquidity pool are safer for people to add to the pool.

**HACK-A-THON:**

* What is the progress of the hackathon templates? This is really tied to the SDK, which is getting closer to being fully fleshed out.
* Looking at having a small scale hackathon by end of October, and a larger scaled one in the new year.
* This will be out on a proposal fairly soon.

**HIGH GUARD:**

* Small group: Mikel, Alan, Bree, Andre
  * Created a group chat in Discord.
  * If you have any ideas you’d like to be considered let someone from this group know.

**OPEN DISCUSSION:**

* Mascot
  * Bree is working on a proposal for a mascot creation competition.
    * She has drawn up a sample – a cute robot
    * Suggestions prefer a more business-like android, perhaps a version of “Polina” – goes back to the reference of a Polina 2.0.
  * There could be more than one mascot, one representing Effect Network, one representing Effect DAO
  * If a competition, there needs to be a prize pool. What amount would be appropriate?
  * The DAO could market.
  * This could just be a concept drawing rather than a clean finished product.
    * The DAO could then commission a finished product from a graphic artist.
  * How would the voting occur?
    * Social media could be used to have the initial round through. So the more ‘likes’ the better. Those with the highest amount of likes would go to a round of voting through the DAO.
      * This would mean the artist would need to do some promoting to get likes.
      * How this happens will require some thought.
* An appeal is going out to anyone to help boost the server in Discord by subscribing in Nitro or adding a booster to your Nitro.
  * This will really help to keep our server up and will help to keep it at level 2. The more people who would help boost the server the better. It would be much appreciated.
* There isn’t much going on with Effect Pieces. Rochelle is working on a possible DAO created NFT plan.

**OLD DISCUSSIONS** (tabled)

* Is it better to build one or two liquidity pairs on one platform PCS, or to diversify platforms?
  *
    * Some more thought on this may be warranted.
    * We want to attract as many people to EFX as possible, without sacrificing too much spread and not getting anywhere.
* Discuss further with team about incorporating worker pay in perpetuity of trained algorithms.

**Potential Proposals:**

* Create a proposal to have a competition for a memeable mascot
* Confidence vote in current HG membership, with conditions set to allow for removals and additions
* Giving the HG general Treasurer responsibilities
* Funds for the MasterChef contract over the next few cycles.
* How to become a guardian guide
* Using Effect Captions to update community made guide videos. Especially videos with lasting relevance. Could be used to promote Effect Captions.
  * Would need to include the quoted price points in the proposal
  * What languages would be prudent to put into the closed captions
    * English only would be about $20
* Timeline
* Proposals to the Foundation:
  * DAO created NFTs
  * Hack-a-thon expenses
