* The DAO has reached Cycle #100, a monumental number.
* Jesse states that there is no roadmap just yet, as he does not want to give specific dates.
* Jeff discusses a new adjustment to the structure of Effect AI, "manager nodes". Manager nodes would reserve task batches instead of workers, and then delegate them to a workforce. The manager node would need to stake EFX and ensure the results are accurate. Manager nodes would get their own rewards for facilitating this process. Jesse discusses these manager nodes further, as a necessary improvement to scale the network, but also allow a better distribution of work.
* Jesse discusses the migration, the blueprint is still being worked on. Not everything is set in stone.
  * It will be a snapshot, this snapshot will be stored in a Solana smart contract. Users would then be able to sign messages with their BSC or EOS wallets to redeem their EFX tokens on Solana.
  * Discussion over whether NFX should be merged into EFX. Currently Effect has a two token model, but going to one token on Solana will help reduce complexity and confusion.
  * There are \~9 million NFX, an exchange rate being discussed is 10 EFX to 1 NFX. This would require 90 million EFX. 82 Million EFX if Foundation NFX are ignored. A vesting period is also discussed, as most NFX right now is staked in the DAO. So it remaining in the DAO for a time would be the status quo. The EFX to fund this would have to come from the DAO treasury and Foundation.
  * Jesse is aiming to preserve DAO stake age for EFX already staked in the DAO.
  * DJSTRIKANOVA brings up a discussion over whether some EOS wallets should be blacklisted, such as the pNetwork EOS wallet (as all the corresponding EFX is on BSC, this would result in double minting) and the Kucoin wallet. So that these EFX are not migrated.
* Miguel had made good progress releasing more clips on https://www.tiktok.com/@effect\_dao
